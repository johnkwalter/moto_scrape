Pro-Wheel Electric Dirt Bike,https://seattle.craigslist.org/sno/mcd/d/lake-stevens-pro-wheel-electric-dirt/7582502763.html,7582502763,"$5,995","Brand new Pro-Wheel electric dirt bike.
Very high quality full size electric motorcycle. This is not a mountain bike turned into a motorcycle like most of the rest you see. It has a 21"" front wheel and 18"" rear wheel. Full disc brakes front and rear with excellent adjustable suspension.
This bike is designed for off-road and trail riding and works very well. Motor output is 3000kw on low and 12000kw on high. You'll be impressed how well it goes.

It also has a clutch with 4 speed transmission and a slow reverse. Since it's electric, it won't die so it's very easy to ride.

We currently have our first bike for testing and for customers to see and ride. Feel free to come out and take a look.
Pro-Wheel will be the importer, distributor, parts supplier, and service center. There are 5 more bikes just leaving the factory end of January and will be here end of Feb. I strongly suggest coming out, taking a look and reserving your bike.
After the next 5 there will be a full container coming over but don't expect those until May.

The bikes come stock with a 72V 40AH battery which last about 3 hours. You can order the bike with battery upgrades for longer lasting ride time. 50AH is an extra 250.00 and a 60AH is an extra 400.00. We will also have new extra batteries available as well.

We will have all parts in stock to keep you going.

Price of $5995.00 is with 40AH battery. When purchasing there will be a freight fee, tax and title transfer. These bikes are a titled bike so you can get your ORV stickers.",new,electric,1,manual,dirtbike,,,,,,,,,

2023 Husqvarna® Norden 901
The Norden 901 is an exceptional adventure touring motorcycle. Powered by a smooth and torquey 889 cc parallel twin engine, which is housed within a lightweight steel trellis frame, it is the complete long-distance travel machine. On road and when ridden across rugged terrain, the Norden 901 excels on every adventure. With premium, high performance offroad suspension, versatile tyres that deliver traction in all conditions, it features ergonomics that ensure enhanced comfort for extended ride times. Explore the world your way with the Norden 901.
Features may include:
Adventure in its core
Geometry
Wherever you plan to go or wherever your inner north navigation takes you, the chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame is designed for distance – able to take the load and deliver day-long comfort. By using the engine as a stressed member, the frame can be light and compact. Engineered to deliver precise feedback with agility and light-handling through the tightest bends, it provides stability and comfort over distance and superior offroad ability on the less-travelled tracks. Although it is compact and light, the frame is as tough as any challenge you give it, carrying luggage, a passenger or both anywhere from the street to the most remote trail. The geometry of the Norden 901 was developed to create a world class travel motorcycle for every voyage of discovery. Seat height is manageable for every adventurer thanks to an angled rear shock. The ergonomics place you towards the front wheel for better feel and grip on all surfaces.
Trustworthy equipment
Suspension
Control and comfort rank high on your list of demands from the Norden 901. With 220 mm of travel, the WP APEX 43 mm upside-down front forks deliver next-level performance and comfort in every environment, whether that means taut handling on tarmac or smoothing the way offroad. You can quickly and easily vary the ride characteristics to suit your own preference and varying conditions thanks to the adjustability of the compression and rebound damping of the forks. Likewise, the WP APEX rear shock offers a generous 215 mm of travel, and is adjustable for rebound damping and spring preload to cater for the roads you ride and the loads you carry. Adjusting the settings is quick and easy, so that when conditions change, you can set the suspension to match them. With comfort and control from compliant suspension, there are less limits to the distance your travels take you.
Engine
Every twist of the ride-by-wire throttle delivers just the right amount of power you require to reach new horizons. A pair of balancer shafts in the 889 cc, double overhead cam, liquid cooled, parallel twin engine increase comfort and reduce vibration, adding to your riding pleasure. The engine has plentiful power, with a maximum output at 8,000 rpm and peak torque at 6,500 rpm. This, combined with finesse and manageability, make the engine capable of delivering everything you demand of it, wherever you want to go. Long service intervals of 15,000 km and low fuel consumption make the Norden 901’s engine even better suited to the tasks you set for it.

2014 Yamaha® Raider S
Some would like to build their own; some would rather ride. Either way we’ve got you covered. The 113-cubic-inch fuel-injected V-twin engine that powers it takes a back seat to no V-twin when it comes to power and reliability. And the rest of the chopper-inspired Raider S is pure Star, designed and engineered by the world’s best bike builders. The “S’ model gets even more chrome: chrome triple clamps, fork sliders, air box cover, engine covers, head-light housing, handlebar risers, and more.

Key Features May Include:

“S” model gets even more chrome: chrome triple clamps, fork sliders, air box cover, engine covers, headlight housing, handlebar risers, etc.

A 6-degree yoke angle—the first ever on a Star® Motorcycle—makes it possible to achieve that custom raked-out look as well as neutral handling and straight-line cruisability: 33-degree rake plus 6 degrees yoke angle gives total rake of 39 degrees and 102mm of trail.

5-spoke wheels carry a 120/70-21-inch bias tire up front, and a wide, 210/40-18 radial out back—the tallest and widest ever on a Star.

Estimated 42 mpg* means this cruiser can go the distance between fill-ups.

113-cubic-inch (1854cc) air-cooled, OHV with 4 valves per cylinder, pushrod 48-degree V-twin pumps out max torque at just 2500 rpm and max power at 4500 rpm for powerful, relaxed cruising.

Four pushrod-activated valves and two spark plugs per cylinder provide optimum combustion efficiency along with classically beautiful engine architecture.

All-aluminum cast frame is lightweight, rigid and tuned for light, athletic handling. A light, Controlled-Fill, aluminum swingarm casting complements the bike’s lithe style.

Low, sculpted seat holds the rider in place, and pullback bars reach back to enforce a casual, urban cruising style.

Custom 5-spoke wheels carry a 120/70-21-inch bias tire up front, and a wide, 210/40-18 radial out back—the tallest and widest ever on a Star.

Nice Nice Nice - Low Hours -

2022 Husqvarna® FC 350
With the agility of a 250 and a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, the FC 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, making for a more user-friendly riding experience in all conditions. It is this versatility, paired with intelligent traction and launch control, which makes the FC 350 one of the most multitalented motocrossers on the market.
For 2022 we upgraded the hydraulic clutch to an all new high-performance Brembo system for perfect modulation at all times. On top, striking new dark blue and white graphics stylishly adorn the Swedish inspired design.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Weighing in at only 27.2 kg (59.9 lb) and churning out serious power, the engine in the FC 350 is designed with performance as a priority. It is also one of the lightest engines in its class.
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at the highest level for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points are specifically positioned to allow seamless movement around the motorcycle.
MAP SWITCH
Optimized for easy operation, the map switch selects between two engine maps, operates launch control and activates a traction control feature. Traction control works by analyzing throttle input from the rider and the rate at which the RPM increases. If the RPM increases too quickly, the EMS will register a loss of grip and reduce the amount of power to the rear wheel ensuring maximum traction.
COOLING SYSTEM
Made using high-strength aluminium, the cooling system on the FC 350 features computational fluid dynamics to channel air through the radiators more efficiently. The cooling system is also integrated into the frame allowing improved cooling by channelling coolant through the frame while eliminating the need for additional hoses.

2017 Honda® Africa Twin CRF1000L DCT
DREAM IT. DO IT. RIDE IT.
For some people, a globe or a map isn’t some route-finding device. It’s a menu. Of all the places they can go, the things to see, the adventures to savor. But unless you plan on walking, you need a way to get there. And that’s why we build the Africa Twin®. The perfect travelling companion for the explorer in you, whether it’s a weekend, a month, or a lifetime. Where will it take you? Let’s look at that map.
Features may include:
PARALLEL-TWIN ENGINE LAYOUT
The Africa Twin®’s parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.
ADJUSTABLE SEAT
The Africa Twin® offers an adjustable rider’s seat. This makes reaching the ground easier, and also lets you fine-tune your riding position in respect to the footpeg and handlebar placement.
LONG TRAVEL SUSPENSION
The Africa Twin® doesn't just look like an adventure bike - it's the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel suspension. The fork features huge 45mm tubes and 9.0 inches of travel, while the single-shock rear suspension is also fully adjustable, with 8.7 inches of travel and a convenient remote preload adjustment.
TRANSMISSION CHOICE
You pick: The Africa Twin® is available with either our standard six-speed manual gearbox, or Honda’s exclusive automatic six-speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Both are excellent choices, and both feature stout, strong steel gears inside—the only difference is who does the shifting.

2018 Husqvarna TX 300
THE FUTURE 2-STROKE
The TX 300 signifies the constant development and secure future of the historic 300cc 2-stroke in the Husqvarna off-road line-up. Featuring the latest technology available, the TX 300 is a purpose-built closed course racing 2-stroke with off-road specific features. A larger fuel tank, an 18-inch rear wheel and a side-stand increase the ability and usability of the TX for its intended purpose. Additionally, the lightweight 2-stroke engine is efficienct, centralizes mass and features very little vibration thanks to a counter balancer shaft. As a result the TX 300 offers a refined and manageable closed course racing package.
Features may include:
Engine
The 300cc 2-stroke engine has for long been the best combination of unsurpassed power and lightweight construction. The simplicity and low maintenance cost of the 2-stroke motor has made it a favorite amongst riders for generations. The TX 300 features an advanced construction with shaft arrangements aimed at centralizing oscillating mass. A counter balancer shaft reduces vibration while a twin-valve controlled power valve ensures optimal performance.
Transmission
A 6-speed wide ratio gearbox complements the off-road usage of the TX 300. An innovative shift lever reduces dirt build up guaranteeing easy operation in even the toughest conditions.
Crankcases
The TX 300 engine is designed with mass centralization as a key theme. As a result the lightweight, die-cast engine cases are developed to accommodate the specific location of shaft arrangements. Additionally the counter balancer shaft is integrated in a very compact manner having little affect on the compact design.
Carburettor
The TX 300 features a 38mm flat slide Mikuni TMX carburettor. This carburettor provides a smooth and controllable power delivery with optimal performance over the entire RPM range. Additionally, the carburettor has minimal sensitivity to changes in temperature and altitude which reduces the need for setting changes in different conditions.
Chromoly steel frame
The hydro-formed, laser-cut and robot-welded frame expertly crafted by WP Performance Systems is specifically designed with calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex which best benefit handling and suspension functionality. The frame is finished off with a premium white powder coating and standard frame protectors guaranteeing supreme protection and durability.
Composite carbon fibre subframe
The composite subframe is a design unique to Husqvarna showcasing pioneering technologies and innovation. This 3 piece component is made up of 30 % carbon fiber making it remarkably light (1.4 kg) and also particularly strong. Specific care is taken to create a certain rigidity for optimal handling and rider ergonomics.
WP AER 48
The 48 mm split air fork features an insulated air spring and pressurized oil chamber for progressive and consistent damping. The new component is lightweight and easily adjustable via a single air pressure valve for pre-load (on the left leg) as well as easy access clickers adjusting damping with 30 clicks (on the right leg). Additionally, the air pump needed to adjust air pressure in the fork will be provided as standard.
Chomoly steel frame
The hydro-formed, laser-cut and robot-welded frame expertly crafted by WP Performance Systems is specifically designed with calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex which best benefit handling and suspension functionality. The frame is finished off with a premium white powder coating and standard frame protectors guaranteeing supreme protection and durability.

2015 Suzuki GSX-S750Z
The original Suzuki GSX-R750 was designed as a street-legal bike that was born on the circuit. The 2015 Suzuki GSX-S750 gives that championship-winning heritage even more street-smart performance. Blending just the right mix of modern sportbike performance with futuristic streetbike style, this 750 is purpose-built for excitement.
Suzuki took the powerful 749cc four-cylinder fuel-injected sportbike engine from the GSX-R750, and tuned it to deliver the perfect power curve for street riding. The engine’s cam profiles have been revised, and the intake and exhaust tracts have been reshaped to boost low-end torque and mid-range power. This gives the 750 unmatched throttle response and intense acceleration. Suzuki dual-throttle valve fuel injection means the performance is crisp and consistent.
Handlebars replace the race bike’s clip-ons, delivering a more upright streetbike style. A complete instrument cluster features adjustable brightness, plus and analog tachometer, a digital LCD speedometer, plus a fuel-consumption meter, gear position indicator, fuel gauge, odometer/trip meter and a clock. The GSX-S750Z comes unique with gold-anodized front fork outer tubes, red-anodized front fork spring adjuster bolts, a matte silver handlebar, red rear suspension spring, and a blue drive chain.
Features May Include
Powerful 749cc 4-cylinder fuel-injected engine is tuned to deliver a dynamic wave of smooth torque and strong acceleration.
Automatic Idle Speed Control (ISC) improves cold starting and stabilizes engine idle while also reducing cold-start emissions.
Suzuki Exhaust Tuning (SET) servo-controlled butterfly valve helps enhance torque, response and acceleration, especially at low-to-mid rpm range.
Throttle bodies with Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) system contribute to cylinder charging efficiency and combustion efficiency for better throttle response and torque at the low to mid rpm range.
State-of-the-art transistorized digital ignition system contributes to a more complete combustion by igniting the mixture at the precise instant.
Iridium type spark plugs provide a more condensed and hotter spark yet last longer.
Inverted KYB front forks feature a design developed in racing and that is mandatory on a serious, high-performance machine.
Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular girder streetbike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests and seat.
Dual front brakes with fully-floating 310mm discs and dual-piston calipers. 240mm rear disc brake with single-piston caliper.
Link-type rear suspension, with a single rear shock absorber working through a progressive linkage. Spring preload is 7-way adjustable.
Carefully sculpted aggressive front bodywork and side pieces with highlights including a vented front fender, molded mirrors, chiseled fuel tank, textured tank side panels, and an angular tail section with integrated LED taillight. Bright and distinctively shaped headlight with a 60/55W halogen bulb.
Integrated dual position lights with patterned blue lenses.
A compartment underneath the removable passenger seat can carry a U-shaped lock or can be used to store small items.
Brightness-controllable instrument cluster, featuring a prominent analog tachometer and a large, digital LCD speedometer readout. The LCD display also includes a gear-position indicator, coolant temperature gauge, fuel gauge, selectable odometer/dual-tripmeter/fuel consumption meter and a clock.
12-month limited warranty.

The good parts:
Goldy (the bike) was repainted about four years ago. There are a few scratches here and there that have occurred since the new paint - but nothing major. Engine has re-machined heads, new cylinders, new pistons, new lifters, relatively new camshaft. Front and rear brake calipers have been rebuilt with new pistons and pads. Brake lines have all been replaced with steel braided cable. Front and rear brake master cylinders have both been rebuilt. The center stand has been re-welded and repaired. All the engine work was performed by Ride West (BMW of Seattle now?) and Vallantine Motor Works.

This bike runs really good. It starts easily, handles great with its low center of gravity, and cruises on the highway at 80mph with ease. The engine sounds real nice too. It's not a loud bike. Mechanically it is in great shape.

Included in the sale with the bike is a copy of the clymer repair manual, a vintage bmw motorcycle picture book, a copy of zen and the art of motorcycle mechanics, two BMW hardshell pannier cases, original BMW toolkit, exhaust manifold crown wrench (needed to change the oil), and a cover to keep it safe when stored outside. If you wear a men's size large I will throw in a very gently used icon 1000 Akorp riding jacket.

Please text me if you want to take a look at it. If you would like to make an offer, I'm open to that.",good,gas,85000,manual,sport touring,,,1067,,yes,,,,

This bike is a perfect run around town, take a nice solo ride or maybe even a day trip kind of bike. With a 2 into 1 exhaust and screaming eagle intake this bike roars down the road. The custom HD seat puts you in the ideal riding position to stay comfortable on your cruise. The bobber conversion was done in house, exposing that massive rear tire and leaving none of it to the imagination. Retains the stock style lighting and license plate as well. In addition to that we have also fitted this motorcycle with a Touratech light bar wired to the brights for those real dark back country rides. To tie it all up the bike also features a custom wrap. Low miles, garage kept, never down.

2018 Honda® Gold Wing Tour Pearl White
THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE TOURING MACHINE
This is a bike 43 years in the making. Rebuilt from the road up. Refined inside and out. Ready for anything. There’s a new engine. New front suspension. Available 7-speed DCT. All in a more agile body that’s over 85 pounds lighter. You’ll also find the latest in technology, including Apple CarPlayTM integration, and five distinct trim levels to suit your style. The 2018 Gold Wing is designed to push the limits of what a touring bike can be. And expand the adventure beyond anything imagined.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
ENGINE
The Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. We’ve kept that same overall architecture, but it’s an all-new 1833cc powerplant for 2018, and over 13 pounds lighter (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).
ALUMINUM CYLINDERS SLEEVES
High-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length. The 73mm cylinder bore and short, high-strength crankshaft also help make the engine more compact.
UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGN
The new engine uses four-valve, Unicam® cylinder head design. That improves engine performance and power, and also contributes to the engine’s weight reduction. The four-valve per cylinder design is also a big part of the new Gold Wing’s improved fuel efficiency.
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION
Want a manual transmission? The new Gold Wing offers the best conventional gearbox in Gold Wing history. Case in point: now you get an overdrive sixth gear.

One look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, new Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.
FRAME
This latest generation all-aluminum frame is significantly lighter and more compact than previous editions. State-of-the-art die-casting lets us fine-tune chassis rigidity, giving you both a smooth ride and precise handling.
SWING ARM/REAR SUSPENSION
Using our proprietary single-sided Pro Arm® design, the aluminum swingarm still houses the Gold Wing’s shaft drive. The swingarm links to the frame using a new, patented pivot structure that both increases stiffness and reduces weight. You get responsive handling and a smoother ride.
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
Have to make a hard stop, fully loaded and two up? All new 2018 Gold Wings are equipped with combined anti-lock brakes for excellent stopping power under a wide variety of road and traction conditions.
ENGINEERING
THROTTLE BY WIRE
The 2018 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system affords a degree of engine control you’ve likely never before experienced. It also enables features like our power delivery modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) which you’ll find on our Gold Wing Tour models.

Well loved and ridden. Bike was disassembled for a full rebuild and some light modification, but too many other projects. Assemble it as is and it runs beautifully, or finish tearing it down and do a full cafe. The bike is complete, and includes a number of spares.

Since the teardown, a couple of modifications:
- Frame has been hooped
- Rear fender was shortened
- Frame and all frame parts sandblasted and powdercoated

Comes with a 4-into-1 exhaust, mini gauges, a modern seat, a new custom wiring harness, and two tanks in good condition.",good,gas,10000,manual,standard,black,clean,750,,,CB750K2803318,yes,,

Description:

2023 Yamaha YZ250F Monster Energy Yamaha Racing Edition
THE RIDE STARTS HERE
The look of a full factory ride with the performance of a multi-time Supercross & Motocross champ. Your Monster Energy-inspired moto weapon of choice awaits.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Monster Energy® Yamaha Racing Edition
Inspired by the multi-championship winning YZ250F raced by Monster Energy® Star Yamaha Racing's pro Supercross and Motocross teams, the Monster Energy® Yamaha Racing Edition features a striking color and graphics package that stands out at the track or on the trail.
Advanced 250cc Four-Stroke Engine
Featuring a high-spec piston, aggressive cam profiles and reversed cylinder head layout, the YZ250F's advanced four-stroke engine is known for its broad, useable powerband and class-leading low-end and mid-range torque.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
Yamaha’s industry-leading Power Tuner App puts the flexibility and precision tunability of the GYTR® Power Tuner into your smartphone. Make fueling and ignition timing changes instantly and upload them to the bike for ultimate track-side tuning. Best of all, it's free-of-charge.
ENGINE
Advanced 250cc Four-Stroke Engine
The YZ250F's liquid-cooled, DOHC 4-valve, fuel-injected powerplant features a forward-positioned straight downdraft intake with symmetrical intake ports, high-spec piston, aggressive cam profiles and reversed cylinder head layout. The advanced four-stroke engine is known for its broad, useable powerband and class-leading low-end and mid-range torque.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner App brings the power of the GYTR® Power Tuner to your iOS® or Android® device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike’s onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
The bilateral aluminum frame features flex characteristics that give riders the ultimate combination of precise cornering performance and handling stability. Large upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability. The wider rear frame spars, and the YZ250F-specific engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of impact absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
Class-Leading Suspensio
Fully adjustable KYB® coil spring-type fork with speed-sensitive damping delivers exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption for championship-winning performance. The linkage-type rear suspension features a KYB® shock optimized to provide less pitch on corner entry/exit and improved stability.

2017 Honda Africa Twin CRF1000L DCT
DREAM IT. DO IT. RIDE IT.
For some people, a globe or a map isn't some route-finding device. It's a menu. Of all the places they can go, the things to see, the adventures to savor. But unless you plan on walking, you need a way to get there. And that's why we build the Africa Twin. The perfect travelling companion for the explorer in you, whether it's a weekend, a month, or a lifetime. Where will it take you? Let's look at that map.
Features may include:
PARALLEL-TWIN ENGINE LAYOUT
The Africa Twin's parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.
ADJUSTABLE SEAT
The Africa Twin offers an adjustable rider's seat. This makes reaching the ground easier, and also lets you fine-tune your riding position in respect to the footpeg and handlebar placement.
LONG TRAVEL SUSPENSION
The Africa Twin doesn't just look like an adventure bike - it's the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel suspension. The fork features huge 45mm tubes and 9.0 inches of travel, while the single-shock rear suspension is also fully adjustable, with 8.7 inches of travel and a convenient remote preload adjustment.
TRANSMISSION CHOICE
You pick: The Africa Twin is available with either our standard six-speed manual gearbox, or Honda's exclusive automatic six-speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Both are excellent choices, and both feature stout, strong steel gears inside the only difference is who does the shifting.

Iron 883™
EVERYTHING YOU NEED, NOTHING YOU DON’T.
2020 Iron 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson® Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look.
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber. And black front forks with gators to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black-as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

1975 Harley Davidson Bobber,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcy/d/clinton-1975-harley-davidson-bobber/7581706684.html,7581706684,"$12,500","JUST IN TIME FOR THE 2023 MOTORCYCLING SEASON, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BUY A TRULY ONE OF KIND BIKE THAT WILL BE SURE TO TURN HEADS, START CONVERSATIONS, AND WILL BE A TREASURE TO OWN. IT IS A FULLY BESPOKE ONE OFF 1975 HARLEY DAVIDSON IRON HEAD SPORTSTER, WITH A 1965 900CC ENGINE BUILT INTO A CLASSIC BOBBER STYLE. IT WAS BUILT BY THE NASH MOTORCYCLE COMPANY (nashmotorcycle.com) AND PAINTED BY A FAMOUS CAR AND MOTORCYCLE ARTIST THAT DOES EXCLUSIVE PROJECTS, SUCH AS THIS.

As you can see from the pictures and video, it is adorned with numerous custom touches like, engraved cases, hand tooled leather seat, springer front end, 21 and 16 inch spoke wheels, magneto ignition, kick start only, right hand shift, custom exhaust, custom fenders, gas tanks, oil tank, and of course the exquisite paintwork, with precision pin striping, metal flake, and art deco design elements. Custom handlebar, vintage headlamp, old fashioned clutch lever brings out the front end. And very hard to do custom push engraving on the primary cover, and Hurst lever to act as the rear brake. This is not a bike for beginners, but for the right person who love old and vintage Harley’s that harken back to a classic and romantic time of motorcycling. Oh, and one more thing, the engine has been completely rebuilt from the ground up by Nash and associates.

We bought this bike about seven years ago, when it was recently finished barring the need for final wiring and magneto install (Included) and fluids added to get it started. But due to other bike projects, (Please see my YouTube channel “Reel T Rides”) this one was held back and put on display in our living room due to its perfect condition and never did the final wiring and mag install. I considered doing that recently, but due to lack of space, addition of fluids, exhaust pipe bluing, and overall desire to keep it pristine, I decided to let the next owner have that honor, with my assistance.

I will pay for the wire and magneto install upon purchase to make sure the new owner has a great running bike.

So now, we must sell our beloved custom bike to make room for new projects and allow someone else to get it on the road, have adventures with it, and enjoy the unique ownership of such a one-of-a-kind bike.

We are asking $12,500 or best offer. Low ballers need not apply as this bike is worth much more.

https://redmondusedmotorcycles.com/products/2015-ducati-panigale-r-3-413-miles
In 2015 Ducati released this model, the 1199cc V-twin Panigale R. It is considered one of their highest performing homologation specials, meaning it was produced as a road legal motorcycle primarily to meet the race sanction requirements of World Superbike (WSBK) for a use in international road racing. Simply put, it is a WSBK level race bike that has been made street legal with lights, mirrors and turn signals.

The key features of the R version lies within the engine of this motorcycle. Many of the internal components of the engine have been lightened. The crankshaft is lightened and balanced using tungsten inserts, it has titanium Pankl connecting rods, titanium intake and exhaust valves, and 2 piston rings (rather than the 3 found on the Standard and S Panigale models).

All of these components allow the engine to build rev's and power much more quickly. The Panigale R also has an increased rev limit of 12,500 RPM (500 more than other versions).

Other unique features to this model include a full titanium Akrapovic exhaust system, manually adjustable Ohlins forks and rear shock, carbon fiber front and rear fender, and the unmistakable and iconic R paint scheme which includes an exposed aluminum tank and white number plates on the upper fairing and tail section.

It comes with a suite of electronic rider aides including three riding modes: Rain, Sport and Race modes with: 120hp, 205hp smooth, and 205 hp full power - respectively. It has an electronic quick shifter for clutchless up and downshifts. It also has wheelie control, and lean angle sensitive traction control & abs.

This specific motorcycles has just received an annual service including engine oil and oil filter replacement and brake & clutch fluid flush.

This is a rare opportunity to own one of Ducati's finest R version sport bikes. Reserve it today.

Description
SOFTAIL® HERITAGE CLASSIC
The Heritage Classic motorcycle used to be a homage to ‘50s chrome nostalgia. Take a look at the new one, and you’ll see it’s anything but that.
THE DARK CLASSIC OF THE MODERN ERA
Lockable and Sealed Saddlebags
A sleek look on the outside and roomy on the inside with enough space to stash your riding essentials. The lids open with one touch.
All-New Softail Frame
A lighter, stiffer frame (compared to previous Softail and Dyna models) that takes the idea of form and function to a place it’s never been before. It’s the look of a hard tail from a bygone era that delivers a thoroughly modern ride.
Milwaukee-Eight Big Twin Engine
A powerful, smooth-running engine with crisp throttle response and a pure, soul-satisfying rumble. Available in 114 engine displacement.
Signature LED Forward Lighting
Darkness-defying lighting that gives you greater visibility at night.
Detachable Windscreen
Go from touring to cruising in a heartbeat. Leave the screen on for a clean envelope of air over the long haul. Or remove it in seconds for a completely new look and ride.
Standard Cruise Control
You can easily dial in your speed to give your wrist a break and keep on hauling down the road.
High Performance Front Suspension
New suspension technology provides the performance of a racing-style cartridge fork for reduced weight with linear damping characteristics.
High Performance Rear Mono Shock
All-new easily adjustable mono-shock rear suspension allows for dynamic cornering capability while preserving the hardtail look.

I have a Ducati 999 here ready for ya! I actually love this bike, to the point that my partner regularly teases me over it, but it really is just too much bike for me. I like taking quick pops around town to avoid parking, and this thing just wants to go fast. On the freeway I barely ever need to hit the 4th gear. It sounds super gnarly too. I've literally only put 200 miles on it in two years.

Everything on it works great! Starting cold takes a couple cranks but keep it on the trickle charger at home and you're all good. Maybe a new battery but I don't even think that's necessary. I haven't done my Summer maintenance on it yet since I figure you'll want to flush it anyways once sold.

COMES WITH A TRANSFERABLE RIDERS ADVANTAGE CARE PLUS PLAN. There is 6 months remaining on the plan, so hopefully that gives you peace of mind. I bought it 2.5 years ago and haven't needed it yet, but pretty sure it's just a basic coverage against breakdown. I'll give you the book with all the information though. I also have a ton of old information I got when I bought the bike. My record keeping past that has been subpar but it's recieved the usually oil changes, etc. and lived in a garage.

Good condition - has some cosmetic scuffs, scratches, small chips etc

Title is branded but not technically rebuilt - When I bought it, the dealership told me the original owner had replaced the gauge cluster and odometer. It was their impression that the new odometer reading was higher than actual (basically rolled the odometer FORWARD). Miles listed 17,300 so should be lower, but can't guarantee that. There is no option for branded vs rebuilt on here.

Thanks for looking!

Have you been wondering if the Honda Dual Clutch Transmission adventure bike is for you?   We received and sold this 2012 Honda NC700X DCT abs last March, the current owner did not see much riding this year and it only has another couple hundred miles since then.  Last time it was in for consignment sale, we never received service history so we took care of some over due items.  We first performed a fall service along with fork seals, fresh battery and an upgraded YSS rear shock absorber, definitely an improvement in comfort over stock!   Overall this bike is in great shape, it does have a set of Honda heated grips installed, it's a great riding and running Honda NC700X DCT.   It comes with our last service records, 2 keys and a clean WA title

Motorcycles are not appliances. Even if your main goal in buying one is to accomplish a daily task like commuting with the lowest possible vehicle and fuel costs, few riders would be satisfied with a motorcycle that is as dull as a dishwasher. We still want performance that excites us, looks that fuel our passions and make the right statement, and an overall ride and features that are well suited to what we want to do, whether it’s sport touring, adventure riding, cruising, commuting or all of the above.   Enter the NC700X, and prepare to be gobsmacked. I kid you not—this is the bike many of you have been asking for…and more. The base model weighs just 474 pounds gassed up and has appealing, adventure-bike styling and suspension travel with relatively low, upright seating that make it pretty good for just about any kind of riding.

And you won’t find its full-face helmet-sized locking storage compartment on anything in this price range that isn’t a scooter.  American Honda doesn’t provide power specs, but in Europe the bike is rated with 47 horsepower at 6,250 rpm (51 for the standard transmission bike) and 44.2 lb-ft of torque at 4,750, similar to a mid-sized cruiser, so there’s enough power for most solo riding, even with the full complement of luggage and accessories.

Rare & low serial# 1966 Honda CL300 w/orig engine. (CL72/CL77 250/305),https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcy/d/seattle-rare-low-serial-1966-honda/7581461606.html,7581461606,"$1,500","Pics taken after I washed the dust off it, it's not this shiny, sorry.

According to noted Honda expert Bill Silver on page 100 of his 'History of the Honda Scrambler' book (isbn 978-02-9855607-0-6 look it up on Amazon, book is well worth it), this is a rare Japanese domestic model Honda CL-77 scrambler from 1966. This is also a very early bike at serial number CL300-1000189 and the engine is original to this bike having engine number CL300E-1000175. Both #'s are stock OEM factory stampings.

There aren't very many Honda collectors with this model in their collection - you'll be one of the few in the United States with this motorcycle. If you have a Honda 250/305 collection you need this bike - where else are you going to find another CL300 let alone a very early one?

Comes with these extra parts included:
1967 CL 77 305 engine for parts if needed
2 extra gas tanks
Extra set of carburetors
Misc. electrical and small parts

Engine is froze (I have the cylinders soaking in penetrating fluid right now) but an extra parts engine is included if you need it for parts. Also an extra ignition switch with key is included too. Needs restoration as seen in the pictures but many American CL77 parts interchange so the restoration will be easy - especially with the all the 250/305 knowledge available at your fingertips.

For sale is a fun 1975 Honda CB360T. The bike is a zippy ride with 34hp and a delightfully smooth 6 gears. Great for daily riding and even longer trips; for example a lovely ride around Mt Rainier as seen in the pictures. The machine runs very well, even at altitude. Easy to ride and easy to work on. Electric starter removed, but available in case you that is your thing. Kicks on easily.
Both carbs are well in sync. Existing air box cover, but new pod filters. New clip-on handle bars, but originals are available as well. New front brake (tested on Mt Rainier). Smaller rear lights assembly for the reduced cafe looks and painted points cover for that extra speed. Replaced old triple tree with new milled version (looks like the original but is something that needed replacing and now not something you have to).
Most original spare parts are available and in usable condition.

I am unfortunately parting with this bike, since I don't live in Seattle anymore. I hope it can bring someone else as much joy as I had with it. I will be in Seattle in February and we can meet up then. Send me an email with any questions you may have.

Description
This 2022 Low Rider S has 103 hp at 4,750, which is just about how much the Milwaukee-Eight 117 engine on the 2021 CVO models. This is the newest slightly used FXLRS with less then 250 original miles in Gunship Gray color. The peak output of 125 lb-ft. at 3500, an increase over the 2021 FXLRS' at 119 lb-ft. at 3,000 rpm. Harley-Davidson is using the tagline ""Further. Faster."" from the Jan. 26 teasers, which supports the premise of an engine upgrade from the previous 1870cc engine to the bigger 1,923cc displacement. The 2022 Low Rider S receives a new Heavy Breather intake similar to the Screamin' Eagle kit from Harley-Davidson's parts catalog. For performance fun come in see the changes and take this beauty home today. You will Love the Ride.

Iron 883™
EVERYTHING YOU NEED, NOTHING YOU DON’T.
2020 Iron 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson® Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look.
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber. And black front forks with gators to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black-as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

2013 BMW G650GS Sertao/Dakar,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcy/d/north-lakewood-2013-bmw-g650gs-sertao/7581215597.html,7581215597,"$6,900","ADVENTURE IS CALLING!

These are rather hard to find bikes. As far as BMW 650s go, this is the best one to own.

When BMW discontinued the F650GS Dakar, they made the G650GS Sertao to replace it.
It is essentially the same bike as the BMW Dakar model with some great improvements. The biggest of which is the digital dash, better windscreen and plastics. The BMW rotax motors are impeccably reliable. OEM Service schedule has been followed religiously. Journal of all maintenance since I’ve owned the bike is readily available.

This bike is ready for world travel, travel up to Alaska, the local mountains or casual commuting to/from work. Makes for a nice beginner bike OR, for those with bigger ADV bikes or street bikes, a desirable option to go cruising some gravels roads and/or the Back Country Discover Routes in WA/ID/OR and beyond. It will easily do 70 MPH all day long with great fuel economy. Bike is solid and has never been abused or crashed. No scratches, and is like new condition. One would be hard pressed to find a cleaner Sertao that is kitted out as nice as this bike. 100% Reliable and extremely clean.

This bike features many nice extras for wherever your Adventures may take you. No stone has been left unturned here in kitting out this bike. For those who dream of touring, camping, world travel or even commuting on a budget, this may be your bike. The extras include:

• Heated Handgrips
• Fuel Injection
• 60-70 MPG (Unleaded gas, ride in carpool lanes. Get there faster and cheaper than those on 4 wheels).
• Bark Buster Hand Guards (OEM guards included)
• After Market Taller windscreen with stronger supports… better than OEM
• BMW F650GS Daka/G650GS Sertao Engine Motor Protection Cage Crash Bar Guard
• Bar Risers (a must for off road standing position)
• LED Headlight upgrade (no more burnt-out bulbs and greater visibility)
• Headlight Guard (Avoid costly replacement of the LED headlight, easy to clean and install)
• Remus single sided Exhaust (saves weight and increases power)
• Tool Tube for increased storage and tools (to be used in conjunction with Remus Exhaust)
• Excel 21 Inch Re-Enforced Front Rim (From Woodies Wheelworks)
• Nuetech Tubliss Tire System installed on front (Never worry about flats again)
• Rear Tire converted to run without tubes (Easy flat repair on the trail)
• Pivot Pegz (Wider platform than OEM pegs for comfort and additional off road capability)
• SW Motech Center Stand (BMW didn’t make a center stand for this bike. Easy field repair and garage maintenance).
• Heed Crash Bars are simply the best option for protection providing crash protection for the radiator, engine and bike plastics. Great place to mount aux lights and bar bags for additional storage of snacks, clothing and tools.
• Touratech Low Fender (This option provides great protection, keeping road grime, mud, stones and water low and away from both the rider and bike)
• R80 GS Accordion Fork Guards (BMW doesn’t provide adequate fork protection, but the BMW R80 fork guards will protect the forks from stones, water, dirt and debris thus extending the life of the fork seals by 3 to 4 times normal service intervals.)
• Touratech High Comfort Seat (Made of breathable DriRide material that stays dry by wicking away moisture from the rider. It’s easy to clean and provides additional riding position. OEM BMW Seat is also included in sale.)
• Shorai Lithium Battery and charger. Very lightweight and much more reliable than lead acid or AGM batteries. This battery will not fail like others in the field and takes several pounds off the bike at the same time.
• Hyperlites – Flashing LED brake Lights that are waterproof, shock resistant and flash when braking. These are a necessary safety item to make yourself more visible and alerts distracted drivers (cell phones anyone).
• Upgraded Rear LED Light that also flashes brightly when braking for additional safety, visibility and no more replacing incandescent bulbs.
• Ratel Footpeg Relocation Kit to increase rider comfort and control of the bike. Used widely by rally racers and much more comfortable for long distance travel. Specifically designed and made in Australia for long distance desert/dirt touring.
• Folding Brake Lever (Nothing like having a tip over on the road, or hitting a rock thereby breaking the shifter or rear brake lever. That can make or break at trip)
• Ratel Case Saver – This upgrade provides a much stronger case saver for the drive sprocket over OEM. Additional advantage is that it is vented allowing mud, dirt and water to egress and makes cleaning easier. Also extends the life of the chain and sprockets.
• Ratel Chain Guide – BMW failed to provide a chain guide for the F650Gs Dakar and G650GS Sertao models which is a shame. With longer suspension travel, the chain is has more slack than the normal F650GS/G650GS bikes and thereby rocks can cause the chain to derail easier (ask how I know). Again, Ratel has stepped up to the plate here and designed a mount that accepts standard Husqvarna or KTM chain guides, so they are easily replaced when needed. It is a must have accessory for anyone considering riding off road whether it be logging roads or more aggressive dirt trails.
• Touratech Rear Luggage rack with accommodation to attach a rotopax container (Carry extra gas, water, tools, etc..)
• Touratech Stainless Steel Luggage racks (German Made. The versatile standard by which all other luggage racks are measured. Many accessories, luggage types, aluminum or soft panniers are compatible with these racks. The fact they are made of Stainless steel means they will not rust or corrode.)
• Giant Loop Around the World Panniers – Made of waterproof impact resistant material that is flexible. Both panniers combined feature 90 liters of packable volume… that’s a lot of groceries or loads of room to carry your gear, tent, clothes, cameras, food, etc.. around the world OR up to the mountains for a weekend camping trip. Completely compatible with the Touratech racks and easily removed for camping, motel parking or day rides.
• Suspension is recently upgraded (Front and Rear) with Touratech Hyperpro suspension. Progressive springs up front and an adjustable rear shock. BMW stock springs are a compromise at best and set up for the lightweight commuter. Adventure touring folks will appreciate the upgrades for highway touring and off road travel if that is where your heart takes you.
• Brand New (zero miles) premium Heidenau K60 50/50 Adv Tire Installed on the rear (long life with aggressive tread for offroad travel and good road manners with long life)
• Includes OEM Toolkit and Original Owners manual and stories of my travels on her.
• Bike is prewired for GPS, Aux Lights, battery tender, USB sockets for charging phones and camera batteries as well as any other accessories your travels may require.
• New chain and sprockets recently installed
• New Fork oil and headset bearings recently installed
• All maintained up to date and then some. Bike is practically wiped daily with a diaper by an anal retentive aerospace engineer.

This bike needs nothing. I would not hesitate to take it to Alaska, around the world or to the local starbucks to socialize with your friends. Given that it’s a BMW ADV bike, you’ll have street cred and look cool. This bike does most everything well. It has been impeccably maintained and cared for. It was not abused, but rather loved, ridden and cared for responsibly. You’ll find no scratches, dings, tears, etc.. and one would have to look real hard to find any dirt on her as well. I keep all my equipment in top notch (like new) condition. Always garaged, stored properly, covered and prepped for the winter months.

Reason for selling. Too many touring bikes. I need to downsize as I am now retired and need to collate my hobbies. I’ll be sad to see her go.

More pictures upon request and happy to answer technical questions. I’ve owned four of these BMW 650 motorcycles over the years. This is by far the best one of all I owned.

Not looking for trades. Bike has clear and clean title. Never stolen, never stored outside, never mistreated and always loved.

Cash only (No cryptocurrency, services, cats, dogs, ex-wives, Nigerian princes, etc.. will be considered).
No test rides without cash, proof of insurance, proper safety gear and a valid endorsement.

Will not consider any lowball offers and not interested in selling on consignment.
Don’t even ask about price without seeing this bike first unless you like being ignored.

All serious enquiries, please include valid email, cell phone numbers and YOUR NAME if you wish to get a serious response. Failure to meet this criteria and you be ignored.

If the ad is up, the bike is still for sale.

“Adventure Before Dementia”. Life is too short to ignore your dreams.

2022 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S Dark Stealth,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcd/d/lynnwood-2022-ducati-streetfighter-v4/7581161018.html,7581161018,"$25,495","The Time Fighter

The Streetfighter V4 SP is the most adrenaline-pumping naked to ever roll its wheels off the production line in Borgo Panigale.

Aesthetically, the SP stands out from the pack thanks to its “Winter Test” livery, which Centro Stile Ducati created by taking inspiration from the bikes used during MotoGP and SBK pre-season testing. A premium equipment derived from the Superleggera V4.

The new carbon rims, 1.4 kg lighter than those of the Streetfighter V4 S, significantly reduce the moment of inertia and contribute to an overall weight saving of 3 kg. The 1103 cc Desmosedici Stradale engine features a counter-rotating crankshaft, “Twin Pulse” firing order, 208 HP of power and 123 Nm of torque at 9500 rpm. The STM-EVO SBK dry clutch ensures a more effective anti-hopping function but also reproduces the characteristic sound that Ducatisti so appreciate. The comprehensive range of equipment is completed with Ohlins Smart EC 2.0 suspension and the Brembo Stylema R® braking system with front callipers.



The essential and captivating “Winter Test” livery has been conceived by the Ducati Centro Stile taking inspiration from the Ducati Corse motorcycles ridden in MotoGP and SBK Championships pre-season tests. The Matte Black of the fairings combined with the Matte Carbon finish of rims and wings, superbly contrasts with the bright Red accents and the sparkling brushed aluminum tank. The new born from Borgo Panigale is also enriched with some beautiful details, such as the progressive number printed on the handlebar and the Italian flag colour scheme on the carbon wings.



The beating heart is the 1,103 cc Desmosedici Stradale with 208 hp capable of delivering a torque of 123 Nm at 9,500 rpm. On the Streetfighter V4 SP the Desmosedici Stradale is fitted with the STM-EVO SBK dry clutch, which guarantees a better anti-hopping function, even in the most aggressive downshifts, and greater fluidity during all “off-throttle” stages, a crucial aspect to be truly effective on the track when pushing to the limit.



Chassis compartment of the exclusive Streetfighter V4 SP is equipped with state-of-the-art technical contents shared with the Ducati Superleggera V4, such as carbon rims and Brembo Stylema R® front brake callipers. High-quality anodized aluminium footpegs, carbon fibre heel guards and brake and shift pedals to minimise the risk of breakage in the event of a slip and designed to quickly switch between traditional and reverse shifting configurations. The SP model shares with the Streetfighter V4 S Öhlins NIX-30 fork, Öhlins TTX36 rear shock absorber and Öhlins steering damper controlled by the second generation Öhlins Smart EC 2.0 system. Unlike the S version, it has the same Panigale V4 springs and hydraulic. The only difference is a fork spring preload reduced from 11mm to 6mm.



The Streetfighter V4 SP is the ideal companion for the amateur who wants to rule the track riding a naked bike and get an instant response. Braking capacity results in fact out of the ordinary, the bike is easier to lay into the corner and gets to the apex faster, not to mention the great stability at high speeds.
The new bike is equipped with the Öhlins Smart EC 2.0 with the event-based system that can vary the damping according to the rider's riding style, and together with biplane wings they increase confidence and ensure the best performance in sporty use.
The STM-EVO SBK dry clutch guarantees a better anti-hopping function.

It comes with a very nice and compelling story that is posted on my YouTube Channel called “Reel T Rides”, under the title ""A tribute to a fellow biker with an emotional ride""

I completely rebuilt the bike, and added, and fabricated new parts to make the bike with the looks that it has today. It is essentially my interpretation of what my idea of a cool hooligan style cafe racer could be.

New parts include, tires, pod filters, hand-made aluminum seat with leather seat pad, handle bars, brakes, head light, blinkers, fly fairing, braided lines, cafe style mirrors, and a few other items.

The engine was gone through by a Yamaha dealer as well as the carb work done by Moto Shed. It runs strong, and because it's shaft drive, very smooth and fast for a bike that's 43 years old.

I would love to keep it, but I need to sell to have funds for another cool bike project that I want to finish.

I am pricing this great bike to sell, but I would consider any, and all good offers too. It would be a wonderful bike to tool around Seattle in, as well as the country roads, and it turns heads everywhere I go.

I can deliver the bike, but no test rides unless you're serious and cash in hand. Just in time for bike season, get it now!!!",excellent,gas,27000,manual,cafe racer,black,clean,750,yes,yes,1J7353247,,,

This stunningly good looking metallic-green Kawasaki Z900RS is in Pristine condition, with super low miles, nice upgraded components and a factory Kawasaki warranty. The classic styling of this bike is paired with a potent 948cc inline 4-cylinder motor. This is an excellent choice for an intermediate to advanced rider looking for a true modern classic that packs a punch.

Kawasaki released the Z900RS first in 2017 as their contender in the growing modern classic segment. This bike is unmistakably old-school-cool with its styling borrowed from the legendary Kawasaki Z1 from the 70's. In its time the Z1 was the most powerful Japanese bike in production.

This new rendition, the Z900RS has an inline 4-cylinder 948cc liquid cooled motor that makes 109 peak horsepower and 73 ft lb of torque. It a thrilling middle-weight power level, both exciting and manageable.

Traction control and Abs are standard on this bike as well, very nice safety features.

This specific example was purchased new from Bellevue Kawasaki in 2021. The dealer upgraded the exhaust system with Akrapovic stainless steel headers. This eliminated the catalytic converter, giving the bike a significant weight reduction (-14 pounds). The ECU was then reflashed by 2 Wheel Dynoworks of Kirkland, WA to optimize performance from the new exhaust system.

An Evotech fender eliminator has also been installed. This nicely cleans up the duck-tailed backend of the bike.

The first service was recently performed by Lake City Powersports in July 2022.

As of writing this listing, the bike comes with 6 months of remaining Kawasaki Proctection Plus Extended Warranty that is transferrable to the new owner.

Look at the photos! This is an amazing bike. Don't hesistate, Reserve it Today!

This bike is a perfect run around town, take a nice solo ride or maybe even a day trip kind of bike. With a 2 into 1 exhaust and screaming eagle intake this bike roars down the road. The custom HD seat puts you in the ideal riding position to stay comfortable on your cruise. The bobber conversion was done in house, exposing that massive rear tire and leaving none of it to the imagination. Retains the stock style lighting and license plate as well. In addition to that we have also fitted this motorcycle with a Touratech light bar wired to the brights for those real dark back country rides. To tie it all up the bike also features a custom wrap.

Selling my Super Duke due to lack of use. Purchased for commuting from Shelton to Seattle via the ferry, but have since moved and no longer need it.

If you are looking at getting a Super Duke, no further introduction is needed. This is not a beginners bike.


Currently 6500 miles on the odometer, and I have the title in hand.

There is some minor cosmetic damage from a low speed, low side. I hit gravel on a round about. This damage is shown in the pictures. The price more than reflects the cost to repair from a dealer, if you wanted, but it is not immediately noticeable.

Maintenance is due, and the service light is on to reflect that. Other than that it is mechanically sound. Feel free to bring a mechanic when you look at the bike. Would be open to you taking to a shop, but some deposit would have to be worked out. Have all manuals, tool kit, and maintenance key.

Not desperate to sell, and am pretty firm on the price. Not interested in trades except for a partial trade on single engine piston aircraft, which is the main reason I am selling.

Everyone knows of this bike and how you have to try and keep the front tire on the ground. Aside from the pure brute power this bike has it also has a surprising amount of creature comforts built into it. Heated seat and grips, cruise control, hot switches, and plenty of rider mode customizations just to name a few. Pure raw fun of a motorcycle. Low miles, recently serviced garage kept, never down.

2022 HONDA Rebel 1100 DCT

Performance
1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINE
The Rebel 1100 sports an engine that redefines what a modern cruiser can and should be. The parallel-twin design in narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. Proven in our Africa Twin, you’ll have plenty of power grunt low, but the Rebel 1100 cruises easy and revs like nothing else in the class.
Engineering
With a bike like the new Rebel 1100. You’re going to want to get out and ride. That’s why we’ve equipped it with cruise control, just like our Gold Wings. Want to kick back and cruise on the open road all weekend long? No problem!
Style
Our family of Rebels are blank canvases for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, they’re not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, fork and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night. We even black-plated the final-drive chain!
Comfort
Low Seat Height
When it comes to cruises and seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, At just 27.5 inches, the Rebel 1100 has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.

CONVENIENCE
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
Here’s a big feature that sets this little bike apart from anything else in our miniMOTO line-up: The Navi features a CVT transmission. That not only means no clutch and no shifting, but no neutral or park either—just start it up, twist the throttle, and go-go-go!
INTEGRATED STORAGE AREA
Taking your stuff with you just got a whole lot easier. That’s because the Navi has a generous, lockable, integrated storage area. It’s big enough to hold a laptop, your lunch, and plenty more—what you use it for is up to you!
COMPACT SIZE
The Navi is small, which is one of the reasons it’s so much fun. That also makes it easy to park. It’s about the same size as another of our favorite miniMOTO bikes—the Grom.
FUEL CAPACITY
Fear the gas station no more! With a one-gallon gas tank, the Navi is super-inexpensive to fill up. And since it’s so fuel efficient, you won’t have to fill up very often.
TWO-UP CAPABILITY
Want to share the fun with a friend? No problem—the Navi comes equipped with a pair of passenger pegs as standard equipment.
AVAILABLE ACCESSORIES
Here are a couple of ways you can make your new Navi even more fun: Why not add an optional windscreen or a rear cargo rack? And check out our available graphics kit too—it’s a great way to personalize your Navi’s look.
PERFORMANCE
109cc FOUR-STROKE ENGINE
One of the best aspects of the new Navi is its dependable Honda engine. It’s air-cooled for simplicity, offers spectacular fuel efficiency, and makes plenty of power. A single-cylinder, overhead-cam design, it’s low-maintenance and super reliable.
HET—Honda ECO TECH
Honda’s Navi engine offers the convenience and power of a gasoline engine, but with our HET (Honda Eco Tech) design, it’s also environmentally conscious.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
With a low 30-inch seat height, getting on and off the Navi is a snap. Even better, it’s easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. The long, flat seat makes it easy to find just the right position and to move around on too, especially for taller riders.
ENGINEERING
ELECTRIC STARTER
Just turn the key, press a button and go. The Navi’s electric starter makes getting underway super easy.
STYLE
FRESH NEW LOOK
There’s no mistaking a Honda Navi, because we’ve given it a fresh look unlike anything out there. It’s about a world away from most scooters, and it’s just begging for you to give it your own personal touches too. Hip and urban, it’s going to stand out wherever you ride it.
FOUR GREAT COLORS
The Navi comes in four awesome colors, so take your pick: Red, Grasshopper Green, Nut Brown and Ranger Green.
HANDLING
10/12-INCH WHEELS
Part of the reason the Navi is so maneuverable are its wheels. They’re much smaller in diameter than a full-sized motorcycle’s (10-inch rear and 12-inch front). That contributes both to the Navi’s small overall size and its light, fun handling.
TELEFORK SUSPENSION
Just like a full-sized motorcycle, the new Navi features a telescopic-fork front suspension for great control and road feel.
SINGLE REAR SHOCK
Thanks to the Navi’s single hydraulic rear shock, you get a plush ride, even over choppy pavement.
STRONG STEEL FRAME
The Navi’s sturdy underbone steel frame is designed to take what gnarly city streets can throw at it, and still provide the basis for this bike’s excellent handling.
FRONT AND REAR BRAKES
The Navi’s brakes are set up like a full-sized motorcycle’s with a front-brake lever on the handlebar and a foot pedal for the rear brake. Plus, Honda’s combined braking system helps you make quick, secure stops.

2023 HONDA Rebel 1100T DCT

DESCRIPTION:
Introducing the new 2023 Rebel 1100T bagger! You get all the best Rebel 1100 features—low seat height, excellent handling, light weight and powerful 1100cc twin-cylinder engine—with the added benefits of hard, locking, weather-resistant saddlebags and a windshield/fairing combination that are just right for longer rides and add tons of style. And speaking of longer rides, don’t forget that every Rebel 1100T comes with cruise control as a standard feature, and anti-lock brakes too. Even though the Rebel 1100T is brand new, we already have an extensive line of Honda accessories ready for you. And here’s a feature that’s sure to become a favorite: Every Rebel 1100T comes with our exclusive Honda DCT Automatic transmission!
Features may include:
STYLE
HARD SADDLEBAGS
This is what makes a bagger a bagger. The Rebel 1100T features a pair of integral, color-matched hard saddlebags that together hold 35 liters—more than enough for a weekend getaway, and super handy even if you’re just riding around town. The top-opening, locking design is weather resistant too. Plus, they add an element of style that’s undeniable—bags are what makes a bagger a bagger!
PERFORMANCE
1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINE
The Rebel 1100T sports an engine that redefines what a modern cruiser can and should be. The parallel-twin design is narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. Proven in our Africa Twin, you’ll have plenty of power grunt down low, but the Rebel 1100T cruises easy and revs like nothing else in the class.
ENGINEERING
SIX-SPEED DCT AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
Our revolutionary Honda automatic DCT gearbox is the transmission of the future, and it’s the perfect choice for a bike like this. Inside, it’s as tough as a conventional transmission, with steel gears throughout. You can let it shift for you, or paddle shifters in the manual mode give you full control. For relaxed cruising, just leave it in automatic mode and you’ll never worry about stalling or hand fatigue in stop-and-go traffic.
COMFORT
HANDLEBAR-MOUNTED FAIRING
The Rebel 1100T features a handlebar-mounted “batwing” style fairing that gives this bike a lot of its street cred and presence, and which is an unmistakable part of its style. Plus, since bagger riders love to ride, its additional wind- and weather protection make it perfect for longer trips—especially since your Rebel 1100T features cruise control too. Want even

CRUISE INTO THE MOTO LIFESTYLE
If you’re interested in the cruiser lifestyle and want to ride the streets with total confidence and comfort, then you’re ready for the Honda Rebel 300. The user-friendly power band, and bobber-inspired styling like a low seat, make this bike easy to enjoy across busy cities and open roads alike. Wherever you take it, available ABS helps protect you from the unexpected, and a full LED lighting package guides your way. Express yourself with a selection of accessories and new colors for 2023, as you join the growing community of Rebel riders revolting against a boring commute.
Features may include:
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.

When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s line-up. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
This technology was first developed and perfected in Honda racing machines. The slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
At Honda, we’re famous for our engines, and we’ve given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalance. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce the overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.

FEATURES:
Comfort
LOW SEAT HEIGHT: When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
LIGHT WEIGHT: The Rebel 300 is a lot more fun and friendly to ride than some bigger machines—perfect if you’re just getting started, or if you’re looking for a nimble bike. The light overall weight and a low center of gravity help performance, too.
NARROW: Super-narrow, especially at the critical tank/seat junction, the Rebel makes it easier to get on and off the bike, and to put your feet down at stops. Plus, the Rebel fits a wide variety of riders.
ROOMY RIDER TRIANGLE: A rider makes contact with the bike at three points: the seat, the handlebar, and the footpegs. The Rebel’s rider triangle strikes the perfect balance between laid-back cruiser and more active sport riding. You ride with a commanding presence, and the minute you sit on a Rebel in your dealership, you’ll know it.
Engineering
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH: This technology was first developed and perfected in Honda racing machines. The slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
SUPERIOR HANDLING: A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.
DIE-CAST ALUMINUM REAR SUBFRAME: Here’s a chance for Honda designers to take a functional part of the motorcycle and make it look extra cool. The aluminum subframe/fender mounts are strong, subtle, light, and provide a solid foundation for the optional/removable passenger seat.
FUEL TANK: One of the key items in motorcycle design is the fuel tank. The Rebel’s iconic fuel-tank shape is timeless, but functionally it also teams up with the bike’s great fuel efficiency to give you plenty of range.
Performance
SPORTY ENGINE: At Honda, we’re famous for our engines, and we’ve given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce the overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.
CAST ALUMINUM WHEELS: Cast wheels front and rear are light, practical, easy to keep clean, and give the Rebel a look that tells you this is not built like a retro machine. The wide rims and tires add to the bikes appearance, too.
Style
BLACKED-OUT STYLE: The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
BLACKED-OUT MUFFLER: Forget about having to polish chrome—the Rebel’s blacked-out exhaust system blends perfectly with the bike’s overall look. And maybe the biggest plus? The awesome sound that's so important to the riding experience.
CLASSIC INSTRUMENT SHAPE: Another iconic element combining traditional and new, the Rebel’s instruments take a classic shape and fill it with totally up-to-date digital LCD information.
ROUND HEADLIGHT: Another critical item in motorcycle design is the headlight. The Rebel 300 features a headlight with a round, three-inch nacelle that gives the bike plenty of character.
ALL LED LIGHTING PACKAGE: LED lighting is where it’s at now. LEDs can be lighter, brighter, and require fewer lifetime replacements than incandescent bulbs. That’s why the Rebel 300 features an all-LED lighting package—headlight, taillight, turn signals, even the license-plate light.
COLOR CHOICES: Check out the bold colors you could be styling: Candy Diesel Red or Matte Black Metallic.
STEEL REAR FENDER: The Rebel has a steel rear fender that's color-matched to the tank. The paint looks great, and the steel fender helps provide a solid support for the optional/removable passenger seat.
WIDE FORK: It’s what’s up front that counts most in style, and the Rebel knocks it out of the park. Of course the front suspension offers precise steering and a plush ride, but the fat fork tubes give the bike a substantial presence too. Last year we fine-tuned the fork for even better comfort and performance, and everyone loves the result.
REFINED REAR SUSPENSION: The Rebel 300’s rear shocks are nitrogen filled, and have a special spring rate too. Just like the front suspension, it's about adding both comfort and performance to your riding experience.

2023 HONDA Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT

DESCRIPTION:
THE GOLD STANDARD OF TOURING BIKES
The open road is calling, and it always has been. Humans are just hard-wired to explore, to want to see what’s over the horizon. Every motorcyclist knows the feeling. And one motorcycle makes it happen better than any other: the Honda Gold Wing. All four Gold Wing trim levels this year get updated highlight strips and colors, as well as a navigation-system map update. But the best parts remain the famously smooth 1833cc six-cylinder engine, refined bodywork for weather protection, and ample luggage. Full of innovative engineering, all Gold Wing models are Android Auto compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay compatibility. You can choose between a conventional six-speed transmission and our exclusive Honda automatic seven-speed DCT transmission, depending on the model. So go ahead—isn’t it time you experience the gold standard of touring bikes?
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
ENGINE
The Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).
ALUMINUM CYLINDER SLEEVES
High-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length. The 73mm cylinder bore as well as the short, high-strength crankshaft help make the engine more compact.
HANDLING
DOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSION
One look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel, giving you more room for added comfort as well as stellar handling.
FRAME
This latest generation all-aluminum frame is significantly lighter and more compact than previous editions. State-of-the-art die-casting lets us fine-tune chassis rigidity, giving you both a smooth ride and precise handling.
ELECTRONICS
ADVANCED METERS
The Gold Wing’s cockpit meters are information central. In addition to the basics like vehicle and engine speed, loading configuration, ride mode, fuel level, engine temperature and dual tripmeters, you can also monitor outside air temperature, cruise control speed, heater levels, and even selected apps linked through Apple CarPlay on an iPhone or Android Auto on an Android phone.
HomeLink
Available as an optional feature, HomeLink lets you integrate your new Gold Wing with devices in your home. A typical example: you can open your home’s garage door without any dedicated controller just touch a switch on your bike’s center console. No more fumbling, and no hassle.
ENGINEERING
THROTTLE BY WIRE
The 2023 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC), available on all Gold Wing models for 2023.
HILL START ASSIST
Both the Gold Wing and Gold Wing Tour models feature Hill Start Assist (HSA). This feature momentarily holds your motorcycle’s position on inclines after you’ve released the brakes and before you apply the throttle, eliminating any roll-back drama. It’s a great convenience when starting from a stop on a hill.
COMFORT AND CARGO
LARGER TRUNK
The Gold Wing’s trunk holds 61 liters. That means in most cases you can get two full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Available accessories include an auto-on interior light, a luggage rack, and more.

2023 HONDA Rebel 500 ABS SE

DESCRIPTION:
UNLEASH YOUR INNER REBEL
Rebels are the ones who refuse to compromise, just like the Rebel 500 refuses to choose between power, precision and style. It’s able to deliver all three in excess, thanks to the timeless cruiser styling, a lean twin-cylinder engine and user-friendly power band. While contemporary features like a full LED lighting package, our Honda slipper/assist clutch and optional anti-lock braking system make for an uncompromising ride down the straights as well as the twisties. New colors for this year will pair perfectly with your favorite gear or accessories, helping you personalize a modern cruiser that refuses to be ignored. Or check out the Rebel 500 ABS Special Edition for a model that comes complete with our most popular accessories, like the diamond-stitch seat and headlight cowl.
FEATURES:
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT: When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
LIGHT WEIGHT: The Rebel 500 is a lot more fun and friendly to ride than some bigger machines—perfect if you’re just getting started, or if you’re looking for a nimble bike. The light overall weight and a low center of gravity help performance, too.
NARROW: Super-narrow, especially at the critical tank/seat junction, the Rebel makes it easier to get on and off the bike, and to put your feet down flat at stops. Plus, the Rebel fits a wide variety of riders.
ROOMY RIDER TRIANGLE: A rider makes contact with the bike at three points: the seat, the handlebar, and the footpegs. The Rebel’s rider triangle strikes the perfect balance between laid-back cruiser and more active sport riding. You ride with a commanding presence, and the minute you sit on a Rebel in your dealership, you’ll know it.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH: Developed and perfected in Honda racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING: A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.
FUEL TANK: One of the key items in motorcycle design is the fuel tank. The Rebel’s iconic fuel-tank shape is timeless, but functionally it also teams up with the bike’s great fuel efficiency to give you plenty of range.
DIE-CAST ALUMINUM REAR SUBFRAME: Here’s a chance for Honda designers to take a functional part of the motorcycle and make it look extra cool. The aluminum subframe/fender mounts are strong, subtle, light, and provide a solid foundation for the optional/removable passenger seat.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE: Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus, it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.
CAST ALUMINUM WHEELS: Cast wheels front and rear are light, practical, easy to keep clean, and give the Rebel a look that tells you this is not built like a retro machine. The wide rims and tires add to the bike’s appearance, too.
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE: The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
BLACKED-OUT MUFFLER: Forget about having to polish chrome—the Rebel’s blacked-out exhaust system blends perfectly with the bike’s overall look. And maybe the biggest plus? The awesome sound that's so important to the riding experience.
CLASSIC INSTRUMENT SHAPE: Another iconic element combining traditional and new, the Rebel’s instruments take a classic shape and fill it with totally up-to-date digital LCD information. The instruments include a gear-position indicator and a fuel-consumption display.
ROUND HEADLIGHT: Another critical item in motorcycle design is the headlight. The Rebel 500 features a headlight with a round, three-inch nacelle that gives the bike plenty of character.
ALL LED LIGHTING PACKAGE: LED lighting is where it’s at now. LEDs can be lighter, brighter, and require fewer lifetime replacements than incandescent bulbs. That’s why the Rebel 500 features an all-LED lighting package—headlight, taillight, turn signals, even the license-plate light.
COLOR CHOICES: Ready for some awesome color choices for 2023? Check out what you can be riding: Candy Blue, Matte Black Metallic or Titanium Metallic.
LIMITED-EDITION REBEL 500 ABS SE: We’re offering a limited edition of our Rebel 500 ABS, the Special Edition version. It features some of our most popular accessories, installed at the factory. You get our Brown Diamond-Stich Seat, Black Fork Boots, Black Upper Fork Covers, and a Black Headlight Cowl—a knockout combination that takes your Rebel 500 to the next level.
STEEL REAR FENDER: Real steel never goes out of style. The Rebel has a steel rear fender that's either color-matched to the tank or matte black. The paint looks great, and the steel fender helps provide solid support for the optional/removable passenger seat.
WIDE FRONT FORK: It’s what’s up front that counts most in style, and the Rebel knocks it out of the park. Of course, the front suspension offers more precise steering and a plush ride, but the large-diameter fork tubes give the bike a substantial presence too.
REFINED REAR SUSPENSION: The Rebel 500’s rear shocks are nitrogen filled and have a special spring rate too. Just like the front suspension, it's about adding both comfort and performance to your riding experience.
WIDE FRONT AND REAR TIRES: The Rebel’s wide front and rear tires not only looks great, but they helps provide excellent handling and stopping power.

2023 HONDA Super Cub C125 ABS

DESCRIPTION:
THE MOTORCYCLE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD
Ask the world to draw a motorcycle, and they’ll draw a Honda Cub. Why? Because this little mighty mite is the best-selling motor vehicle on the planet, period. And that’s no accident: the Cub has features that the whole world can appreciate: reliability, simplicity, economy . . . and that great universal, fun! Plus, the 2023 Super Cub features front-wheel ABS, electric starting, and fuel injection. Lightweight and easy to handle, the step-through chassis makes it super user friendly in traffic or around town, and the four-speed semi-automatic transmission means you’ll never have to deal with a clutch. Best of all, its excellent fuel efficiency means you can travel far on a single tank of gas. For 2023, it’s even available in a new Pearl Gray color scheme that’s both classic and contemporary at the same time. Ride a Honda Cub, and you’re riding the world’s favorite motorcycle!
Features:
Handling
STANDARD ABS: Our front-wheel Anti-Lock Braking System (comes standard on the Super Cub) can be a big help in making controlled stops in less-than-ideal conditions, like on wet pavement or other compromised surfaces. It’s a great feature whether you’re using your new bike as a commuter or just riding it for fun, since it helps you stop with added confidence.
17-INCH CAST WHEELS: Big enough to roll along smoothly, the machine-finished cast construction on these wheels means they’re easier to keep clean than the traditional spoke design.
FRONT SUSPENSION: The Super Cub’s telescopic front suspension is partially faired in, blending with the upper bodywork. It looks awesome, and works a lot better than the original leading-link design.
TUBELESS TIRES: Here’s another thoroughly modern touch: The Super Cub uses tubeless tires.
TWIN REAR SHOCKS: The original Cub had twin shocks, and so does the 2023 Super Cub. They not only look proper, but they also do a great job of smoothing out the road
Performance
125CC FUEL-INJECTED ENGINE: Nobody can match our reputation for engines, and even though the Super Cub is relatively compact, it’s a giant in terms of performance and reliability.
EASY TO PARK: Because the Super Cub is compact, it’s easy to park in the city, and to store when you’re not riding. There’s always room for a Super Cub!
HYDRAULIC FRONT DISC BRAKE: The Super Cub features a large front single disc brake for excellent stopping power. There’s even standard front-wheel ABS.
Style
STEP-THROUGH CHASSIS: This is one of the key design elements which made the original Cub so popular. The Super Cub’s step-through design incorporates frontal bodywork to help shield you from the wind and road splash. It’s not only super convenient, but makes it easy to get on and off the bike.
LOW SEAT HEIGHT: At just 30.7 inches, the Super Cub’s super-low seat makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights.
MULTI-FUNCTION DIGITAL INSTRUMENTS: Retro meets modern in the Super Cub’s instruments. The faired-in handlebar-mounted features speedometer, odometer, A&B trip meters, fuel gauge, clock, and indicator for low/high beam.
ROUND HEADLIGHT: The Super Cub’s round headlight looks retro, but its LED performance is totally up to date and provides excellent illumination and visibility.
UNDERSEAT FUEL TANK: With its 1.0-gallon fuel tank and awesome fuel efficiency, the Super Cub is super practical. The tank filler is under the seat so it’s easy to access.
Technology
FOUR-SPEED SEMI-AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION: The Super Cub features a four-speed semi-automatic transmission that you shift with your left foot, like a traditional motorcycle. But here’s the unique feature: there’s no clutch to worry about—you just toe and go.
ELECTRIC SEAT OPENER: Need to release the seat latch for a fill-up? Just press a button—the lock is all electronically controlled on the Super Cub.
LED LIGHTING: Old-school light bulbs may have been great in 1959, but 60 years later the Super Cub comes with a modern LED lighting package.
SMART KEY: Just like our top-of-the-line Gold Wing, the Super Cub uses a convenient smart-key ignition.

DESCRIPTION:
UNLEASH YOUR INNER REBEL
Rebels are the ones who refuse to compromise, just like the Rebel 500 refuses to choose between power, precision and style. It’s able to deliver all three in excess, thanks to the timeless cruiser styling, a lean twin-cylinder engine and user-friendly power band. While contemporary features like a full LED lighting package, our Honda slipper/assist clutch and optional anti-lock braking system make for an uncompromising ride down the straights as well as the twisties. New colors for this year will pair perfectly with your favorite gear or accessories, helping you personalize a modern cruiser that refuses to be ignored.
Features:
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT: When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s line-up. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
LIGHT WEIGHT: The Rebel 500 is a lot more fun and friendly to ride than some bigger machines—perfect if you’re just getting started, or if you’re looking for a nimble bike. The light overall weight and a low center of gravity help performance, too.
NARROW: Super-narrow, especially at the critical tank/seat junction, the Rebel makes it easier to get on and off the bike, and to put your feet down flat at stops. Plus, the Rebel fits a wide variety of riders.
ROOMY RIDER TRIANGLE: A rider makes contact with the bike at three points: the seat, the handlebar, and the foot pegs. The Rebel’s rider triangle strikes the perfect balance between laid-back cruiser and more active sport riding. You ride with a commanding presence, and the minute you sit on a Rebel in your dealership, you’ll know it.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH: Developed and perfected in Honda racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING: A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.
FUEL TANK: One of the key items in motorcycle design is the fuel tank. The Rebel’s iconic fuel-tank shape is timeless, but functionally it also teams up with the bike’s great fuel efficiency to give you plenty of range.
DIE-CAST ALUMINUM REAR SUBFRAME: Here’s a chance for Honda designers to take a functional part of the motorcycle and make it look extra cool. The aluminum subframe/fender mounts are strong, subtle, light, and provide a solid foundation for the optional/removable passenger seat.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE: Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus, it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.
CAST ALUMINUM WHEELS: Cast wheels front and rear are light, practical, easy to keep clean, and give the Rebel a look that tells you this is not built like a retro machine. The wide rims and tires add to the bike’s appearance, too.
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE: The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
BLACKED-OUT MUFFLER: Forget about having to polish chrome—the Rebel’s blacked-out exhaust system blends perfectly with the bike’s overall look. And maybe the biggest plus? The awesome sound that's so important to the riding experience.
CLASSIC INSTRUMENT SHAPE: Another iconic element combining traditional and new, the Rebel’s instruments take a classic shape and fill it with totally up-to-date digital LCD information. The instruments include a gear-position indicator and a fuel-consumption display.
ROUND HEADLIGHT: Another critical item in motorcycle design is the headlight. The Rebel 500 features a headlight with a round, three-inch nacelle that gives the bike plenty of character.
ALL LED LIGHTING PACKAGE: LED lighting is where it’s at now. LEDs can be lighter, brighter, and require fewer lifetime replacements than incandescent bulbs. That’s why the Rebel 500 features an all-LED lighting package—headlight, taillight, turn signals, even the license-plate light.
COLOR CHOICES: Ready for some awesome color choices for 2023? Check out what you can be riding: Candy Blue, Matte Black Metallic or Titanium Metallic.
STEEL REAR FENDER: Real steel never goes out of style. The Rebel has a steel rear fender that's either color-matched to the tank or matte black. The paint looks great, and the steel fender helps provide solid support for the optional/removable passenger seat.
WIDE FRONT FORK: It’s what’s up front that counts most in style, and the Rebel knocks it out of the park. Of course, the front suspension offers more precise steering and a plush ride, but the large-diameter fork tubes give the bike a substantial presence too.
REFINED REAR SUSPENSION: The Rebel 500’s rear shocks are nitrogen filled and have a special spring rate too. Just like the front suspension, it's about adding both comfort and performance to your riding experience.
WIDE FRONT AND REAR TIRES: The Rebel’s wide front and rear tires not only looks great, but they helps provide excellent handling and stopping power.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 Husqvarna 701 Enduro
Knowing no boundaries, the versatile 701 Enduro is incredibly proficient within urban environments and truly excels on its favoured offroad terrain. Inspired by the brand's enduro world championship winning machines and manufactured with advanced engineering techniques, together with state-of-the-art electronics and multiple rider aids, the 701 Enduro delivers unrivalled performance.
Features may include:
Precisely engineered
Frame
The lightweight trellis frame is made of high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel and developed to ensure precise handling and instil complete confidence in the rider. Detailed feedback is transmitted to the rider thanks to precisely calculated torsional rigidity and longitudinal flex.
Polyamide rear subframe and tank
The self-supporting rear subframe with integrated 3.4 gal (13 liter) fuel tank is perfectly positioned for the best possible weight distribution. Produced in a thermoplastic rotational moulding process, the single-piece construction weighs only 11.4 lbs (5.2 kg) and is made of high-strength polyamide.
A masterpiece
Engine
The single overhead camshaft, liquid cooled, single cylinder engine features the latest in design and electronic technology. An outstanding maximum power output of 55 kW (74 hp) at 8,000 rpm and torque of 73,5 Nm at 6,500 rpm leave the rider in no doubt of the performance packed inside this lightweight unit.
Cylinder head
The compact design of the single overhead camshaft, 4-valve cylinder head features 42 mm intake valves and 34 mm exhaust valves actuated by a robust rocker arm system which delivers precise valve timing at high engine speeds. Ignition is via a dual spark plug layout, each of which has an individual ignition timing control for optimal fuel combustion in the large bore combustion chamber.
Perfect control
Wheels
Black D.I.D rims made of high strength aluminum alloy add an aggressive and modern look to the 701 Enduro. The offroad capabilities of the 701 Enduro are underlined by the 21 front and 18 rear wheel diameter.
Brakes
The latest ABS technology from Bosch is combined with high performance brakes from Brembo: a two piston floating caliper and disc at the front as well as a single piston caliper and disc at the rear (both floating wave discs, 300 and 240 mm diameter respectively). The latest corner sensitive ABS technology from Bosch guarantees maximum braking confidence and can be fully disengaged for more advanced riders.
Premium technology
Bodywork
Sleek, modern bodywork is ergonomically designed to connect the rider to the motorcycle and allow for unrestricted movement in all situations. The riding experience is further enhanced by the extended seat, which reaches over the radiator shrouds for improved grip and control in tighter corners. Additionally, a USB socket is neatly positioned behind the headlight mask for a convenient and continuous power supply for all navigational devices.
CNC-machined triple clamps
As on the other major components of the chassis, the anodized CNC-machined triple clamps have a precisely engineered flex designed to allow the fork tubes to flex under stress. This gives the rider more feeling under braking and on rough terrain.

2023 Honda Rebel 500
UNLEASH YOUR INNER REBEL
Rebels are the ones who refuse to compromise, just like the Rebel 500 refuses to choose between power, precision and style. It's able to deliver all three in excess, thanks to the timeless cruiser styling, a lean twin-cylinder engine and user-friendly powerband. While contemporary features like a full LED lighting package, our Honda slipper/assist clutch and optional anti-lock braking system make for an uncompromising ride down the straights as well as the twisties. New colors for this year will pair perfectly with your favorite gear or accessories, helping you personalize a modern cruiser that refuses to be ignored. Or check out the Rebel 500 ABS Special Edition for a model that comes complete with our most popular accessories, like the diamond-stitch seat and headlight cowl.
Features may include:
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one's not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone's lineup. It's comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
Developed and perfected in Honda racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It's technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the Rebel 500's engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus, it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.

The Vespa has low miles for the year with 5400 miles. I don’t ride the Vespa all that much and would rather have someone else enjoy this beauty. This Vespa is actually classified as a motorcycle, so the new owner needs to have a motorcycle license to legally ride her on the streets. Since the Vespa comes with a 300cc engine, the Vespa is capable of doing about 90 mph on the freeway. For the full price of $3500, I will throw in a new set of Michelin tires for the Vespa.

Summary Specs:

- Made in Italy
- 2 owner
- WA Salvage title
- 5400 miles
- 300cc engine

If you have any questions, please contact me Dan 425-220-169 nine. The Vespa does come with a salvage title due to the fact that it was tipped over by the original owner, so there is a little small dent on the right side of the Vespa scooter. The dent is hardly noticeable from about 10ft and is only cosmetic in my opinion. I went ahead and replaced the chrome trim moldings on both sides of the Vespa and replaced the mirrors with handle bar mirrors.",,gas,5400,automatic,,,salvage,300,yes,yes,,,,

She may be a 2022 VIN but she is all 2023!
2022 Husqvarna FC 250 Rockstar Edition
All new for 2022. The FC 250 Rockstar Edition is undoubtedly the best 250cc motocross machine ever built by Husqvarna Motorcycles. Multiple refinements and upgrades to the engine, suspension, and chassis create a faster and more agile machine. The finished product is a competition-ready, high performance racing motorcycle.
Features may include:
01. Finest Componentry
Exhaust system
Designed from lightweight aluminum, the exhaust system on the FC 250 Rockstar Edition features a flow-designed resonance chamber that is integrated into the header pipe. The silencer has a short and compact design, delivering impressive power output while keeping decibels as low as possible.
Factory wheel set
For unrivalled durability, the hubs used on the Factory Wheel Set are CNC-machined from forged aluminum then anodized black for a true race team look. The hubs are then laced to black D.I.D. DirtStar rims with high quality spokes to create a strong, lightweight wheel set. The reduction in unsprung weight contributes to improved overall handling.
02. Uncompromised Ability
Bodywork
Beneath the race team replica graphics, the new bodywork is designed to enhance unrestricted movements and allow riders of all abilities to perform at their very best for extended periods of time. Complete with a high grip GUTS Racing seat cover, superior control in all conditions is guaranteed.
Fork
Featuring a capsulated air spring and pressurized oil chamber, the new WP XACT 48 mm split air fork delivers incredible performance. With oil and air bypasses reducing pressure peaks, in combination with a mid-valve damping system the fork provides exceptional feedback and rider comfort. A new hydrostop system creates a more progressive damping force in the last 40 mm of travel for improved bottoming resistance.
03. Class-Leading Performance
Cylinder head
Optimal performance is guaranteed from the revised DOHC cylinder head thanks to the DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coated finger followers minimizing friction. These actuate the large titanium valves (32.5 mm intake, 27.5 mm exhaust) and introduce the fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber to create efficient, best-in-class power throughout the 14,000-rpm rev range. Further updates include new valve timings adapted to the new valve measurements, which work in perfect unison with the redesigned camshaft.

-Horn doesn't work
-Fuel gauge doesn't work

2023 KTM 350 EXC-F
Widely known for its 250-like agility and 450-like power, the KTM 350 EXC-F has become a dual-sport to be reckoned with. Thanks to its potent combination of sheer rideability and next-level capability in any terrain, it holds all the cards in the dual-sport world.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Engineered to find the perfect balance of agility, weight, and power, the KTM 350 EXC-F's fuel-injected DOHC engine is set to become a future legend. Its class-leading power delivery and lightweight give it an unbeatable power-to-weight ratio too. A long story short, this is the most perfectly balanced powerplant on the market.
Cylinder Head
The KTM 350 EXC-F engine is fitted with a compact DOHC cylinder head for optimal mass centralization while contributing to even better handling. The head configuration, with 2 overhead camshafts controlling the gas flow through the ports, promises outstanding, dual-sport specific engine characteristics. The DLC coated finger followers, as well as the lightweight valves they actuate (intake 36.3 mm, exhaust 29.1 mm), allow for higher engine speeds, a crucial factor in the 350's dynamic performance.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM EXC models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed - not to mention FACTORY RACING style thanks to the striking orange coating. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 900 grams providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
Swingarm
The KTM 350 EXC-F features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exceptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM EXC models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
Footpegs
Self-cleaning footpegs prevent mud from clogging up the pegs, even when dragging them through deep ruts. This means your boots maintain their grip, and you maintain your focus on the trail.

Comments for this 2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM:
Here now! Fun Fun!
2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM
Suzuki's 2022 SuperMoto DR-Z400SM is based on the proven DR-Z400S. So it combines Supermotard style and features in a narrow, lightweight, street-legal package. This bike brings off-road soul and fun to paved roads. It's not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.
Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide, spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor. The inverted fork contributes to less unsprung weight and improved overall handling, while the large brake and wider rims with high-grip tires offer an exhilarating sportbike experience.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Lightweight, 398cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, dry-sump engine produces strong, tractable power.
Compact, four-valve cylinder head has 36mm intake valves, 29mm exhaust valves, narrow 28-degree included valve angle, and shim-under-bucket valve adjustment system.
Simple electric starting is powered via a lightweight starter motor with an automatic mechanical decompression system.
TRANSMISSION
Compact, five-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with a separate magnesium outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance.
Low-maintenance, long-life, sealed O-ring type drive chain produces minimal sounds when riding.
CHASSIS
Wide, black-anodized RK Excel aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes are fitted with sporty radial tires: 120/70-R17 front and 140/70-R17 rear.
Strong braking performance is supplied by a front disc brake with a large 300mm floating-type rotor and dual-piston caliper, plus a 240mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper.
Long travel, Showa inverted front fork is derived from the RM250 and features adjustable compression/rebound damping and a special coating on inner tube surfaces for smooth action.
ELECTRICAL
Compact, digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.
ADDITIONAL
12-month unlimited mileage limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP).*
A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for DR-Z400SM owners are available, including a low-profile seat, cargo rack, handguard set, and a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.

The ULTIMATE woods bike is back in stock... Who wants it?
2023 KTM 300 XC-W Erzbergrodeo
Named after the Iron Giant itself, the 2023 KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO sits atop the throne of the extreme enduro kingdom. Based on the wildly capable and unmatched KTM 300 XC-W, it brings a new level of extreme to the fore. Sporting a hardcore, READY TO RACE parts list and commemorative graphics set, it is 100% built for the purpose of conquering the world's most extreme enduro race. You could even say, then, that the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO rules the roost.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
A legend in its own right, the KTM 300 cc 2-stroke engine has long been a favorite when it comes to enduro weaponry. This is largely down to its exceptional power, low-down torque and overall light weight. Thanks to state-of-the-art engineering, innovative 2-stroke design, and revolutionary TPI fuel injection technology, this powerplant has become a truly refined unit.
Cylinder
The cylinder on the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO has a bore of 72 mm and is fitted with a sophisticated power valve, providing ultra-smooth and controllable power characteristics. Being fuel-injected, the cylinder features two lateral domes which hold the fuel injectors, supplying fuel to the rear transfer ports. The downstream injection guarantees excellent atomization of the fuel with the upstreaming air. Thus, the loss of unburnt fuel is minimal for fewer emissions, more efficient combustion, and reduced fuel consumption. The cylinder also features a state-of-the-art power valve unit with a sophisticated mechanism for the lateral support exhaust ports. The exhaust port layout increases engine performance, while the upper contour of the exhaust port has been machined to ensure more accurate port timing.
CHASSIS
Frame
The KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO features a high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frame, finished in a striking and durable orange powder coating. Sporting race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider, the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO is rock-steady at speed, while providing unmatched agility and maneuverability in the extra rough stuff.
Swingarm
The KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exeptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XC-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip. Addionally, the KTM 300 XC-W TPI ERZBERGRODEO is equipped with a handlebar map select switch, which lets you select between a standard and advanced power curve.
Seat
Tailored to meet the needs of the world's fastest backsides, this durable seat offers great comfort, helping you master the most challenging terrain all day long.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Footpegs
Sophisticated ?No-Dirt? footpegs prevent clogging up the pegs, even when digging in deep ruts. The pegs on the Enduro models are 6 mm higher than the ones used on SX models, which benefits ground clearance. But you can swap them at will.

2023 Honda GROM
GROM-IT!
The Honda Grom is one of the most popular motorcycles on the planet, and one ride will tell you why. And even when you're not riding one, a Grom is just fun to own. They're a vehicle for self expression in so many different ways. But what always stays the same is the dependability and quality you can count on with every Honda and every Grom. That starts with the 124cc electric-start engine. Fuel injection and a 10:1 compression ratio contribute to the awesome fuel efficiency a crazy-good 166 miles per gallon!* A five-speed transmission works just like a bigger motorcycle's for excellent performance. And the plug-and-play body panels are easy to remove if you want to add some custom graphics of your own it's like a blank canvas that you can ride. There's even a version with optional anti-lock brakes. Hey, everyone has someplace to go why not have fun doing it? Get there on a Grom.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
124cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINE
Nobody can match our reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it's a giant in terms of performance and reliability.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
At just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the seat features thick padding so it's comfortable, especially for taller riders.
ENGINEERING
HYDRAULIC DISC BRAKES
The Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.
STYLE
UNIQUE BODYWORK
Part of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. Plus, its unique bodywork is easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.
LED HEADLIGHT
The Grom's LED projector-style headlight not only looks great and is a major styling element, but it also provides excellent illumination.

Here comes the DR-Z125L to make sure young and smaller stature riders can tackle the dirt. Larger 19-inch front and 16-inch rear tires, as well as a front disc brake, deliver big bike performance to a size-appropriate motorcycle. Here's the perfect platform to build essential riding skills upon, as the DR-Z125L has a true manual clutch and a five-speed transmission so riders can develop these skills as they advance within the sport of motorcycling. Styled to mirror Suzuki's Championship-winning RM-Z and RMX models, this DR-Z arrives with a race-oriented look, while the sharp handling and strong low-end and mid-range power provide the get-up-and-go that defines off-road bikes. The bike's race ready looks prove you can't judge a book by its cover, because the DR-Z125L is an unassuming, easy to ride package packed with loads of fun.
Features may include:
Compact and reliable, 124cc, 4-stroke, single cylinder engine
Smooth-shifting transmission with easy-pull clutch
Strong steel frame and beam-style swingarm
Telescopic forks and link-type rear suspension
Champion-approved RM-Z styling with new graphics

Compact, 124cc, four-stroke, single cylinder, SOHC, air-cooled engine provides strong low- to mid-range power delivery that can be easily handled.
Precise digital CDI ignition system has an ignition-timing map that's tuned to optimize the engine's power characteristics.
Mikuni VM20SS carburetor contributes to excellent throttle response.
Suzuki Composite Electrochemical Material (SCEM)-plated cylinder is used for durability, weight reduction, and superior heat transfer.
Transmission
Five-speed transmission with link-type, foot-operated gearshift system for precise operation and good feedback to the rider.
Easy-pull, rack-and-pinion manual clutch lets the rider control takeoffs and power delivery.
Chassis
Lightweight, high-rigidity steel pipe frame and rear beam-style swingarm are designed specifically to create a compact, mid-sized off-road machine.
Lightweight aluminum rims (19-inch front/16-inch rear) for reduced weight contribute to agile handling and smooth suspension performance.
The seat and bodywork design provides a seamless surface for easy maneuverability.
Appropriate 32-inch seat height lets the bike fit a variety of riders.

2023 KTM 690 Enduro R
Ride from home and feel the adrenaline build while chasing tarmac curves towards your favourite offroad location. No trailer required just twist the throttle of the KTM 690 ENDURO R, which really comes into its own when the dirt begins and the trail gets more extreme. Its lightweight chassis, aggressive styling, and trusted 690 LC4 motor, are enhanced by the latest electronics and WP XPLOR suspension. Master more challenging terrain on this lightweight, high-performance king of versatility.
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The engine combines powerful acceleration from the very lowest revs with an outstanding free-revving nature and refined engine running. Another big plus: It's extremely economical with fuel.
Cylinder Head
A lightweight, compact cylinder head contains four valves and a single camshaft placed over the intake valves, with a secondary balancer shaft driven by the timing chain. The intake valves are actuated by finger followers and the exhaust valves by a rocker arm.
Exhaust
The KTM 690 ENDURO R features a specifically developed exhaust system made from the highest-quality stainless steel, which is not only compact and optimized for offroad use, it is emissions compliant too.
CHASSIS
MASTER THE RIDE
Frame
The trellis frame is manufactured from lightweight sections of top-quality chrome-molybdenum steel tubing of varying thicknesses. This type of balanced frame design provides high torsional rigidity for best handling and rideability, while a more specifically-tuned longitudinal flexibility can absorb the wheel impact energy, supporting the suspension for reduced rider fatigue.
Subframe
The innovative use of the rear fuel tank as the main structural element of the subframe, keeps weight low and eliminates design complexity.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
The lightweight tapered 808 mm wide handlebars are rubber mounted to reduce vibrations. Their width and shape are aimed at providing maximum control in all situations.
Footpegs
Sophisticated No Dirt foot pegs prevent jamming up of the pegs, even when digging your way through deep ruts or navigating wet terrain. Rubber inserts can be mounted for street use to help reduce any vibration that might be felt through the pegs on smooth roads.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Keeping true to its enduro roots, the KTM 690 ENDURO R sports a simple, but effective dashboard. Providing riders with essential information its slimline design keeps the view forward clear of any obstructions. After all, when you're blasting across challenging terrain, you don't want any distractions.
Rider aids
Electronic fuel injection, ride-by-wire and the engine management system (EMS) make it possible to offer innovative yet easy-to-use electronic rider aids. These features can be selected, deselected and utilized to put the potent new-generation LC4 motor to effective use in a much wider range of terrain types and conditions.

2020 LIVEWIRE™
The first Harley-Davidson® electric motorcycle. Instant power and acceleration. Delivers a level of exhilaration unlike anything else.
A LOOK TO STOP PEOPLE IN THEIR TRACKS
From the muscular shape of the motor to its aggressive stance, LiveWire™ motorcycle delivers the iconic look you expect from a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle.
0 TO 60 IN 3 SECONDS
Get instantaneous power the moment you twist the throttle. No clutch to release. No gears to run through. All you do is flick your wrist and take off.
146 MILES CITY RANGE
The LiveWire™ motorcycle features a high-voltage battery (or RESS; Rechargeable Energy Storage System) composed of lithium-ion cells surrounded by a finned, cast-aluminum housing. The high-voltage battery provides 146 miles (235 km) of city range or 95 miles (152 km) of combined stop-and-go and highway range.
TWO EASY WAYS TO CHARGE
Use the onboard Level 1 charger and power cord to connect to any standard household outlet and get a full charge overnight. For a faster charge, visit any public Level 3 DC Fast Charge station for 80% charge in 40 minutes or 100% charge in an hour.
REFLEX DEFENSIVE RIDER SYSTEMS (RDRS)
A new collection of technologies that help give you confidence and control in less-than-ideal situations. The systems utilize advanced chassis control, electronic brake control and powertrain technology to assist you with accelerating and braking in a straight line or while in a turn.
RIDE MODES
LiveWire™ offers seven selectable Ride Modes that electronically control the performance characteristics of the motorcycle and the level of Reflex™ Defensive Rider Systems (RDRS) intervention. Each Ride Mode consists of a specific combination of power, regeneration, throttle response, and traction control settings. LiveWire comes with four pre-programmed modes: sport, road, range, and rain, along with three ride modes the rider can customize.
H-D™ CONNECT SERVICE
Meet the world’s most connected motorcycle experience. With cellular telematics connectivity powered by Panasonic®, you can connect remotely through your smart phone using the latest version of the Harley-Davidson™ App. Check bike vitals like battery charge status, see its location on a map, and get security alerts if it’s been bumped, tampered with or moved.

Description
Roadster™
The new Roadster™ motorcycle combines stoplight-to-stoplight power, agility and garage-built custom style to shatter every mold.
PURE ADRENALINE MEETS GARAGE-BUILT CUSTOM STYLE
1200 cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
An iconic V-Twin engine that is renowned for its massive low-end torque and soul-satisfying sound. Lightweight aluminum heads and cylinders improve air-cooling efficiency.
Blacked-Out Styling
There’s plenty of black to bring a dark edge to the garage-built look of the Roadster™ motorcycle. The mirrors, belt guard and headlamp are black. The oval air cleaner has a black insert. There are slotted black exhaust shields and a blacked-out powertrain.
Slammed Handlebars and New Gauge
You get the performance look and feel of slammed handlebars that put you in an aggressive riding position. And the gauge includes a speedometer and tach so you can keep track of what’s going on in your power plant.
43mm Front Suspension with Inverted Forks
The 43 mm front suspension with inverted forks features cartridge damping and the brawny look of massive new triple clamps. They’ll keep your rubber on the road when the pavement gets rough.
Dual Disc Front Brakes with Floating Rotors
Dual disc front brakes with floating rotors so you can be more confident in your stopping with all that muscle behind you.
Aggressive and Comfortable Two-Up Seat
The optimal combination of comfort and custom style. It’s a low profile, two-up seat with a nice, deep scoop to keep you firmly planted under acceleration, and it puts you just 29.5 inches off the ground for a low center of gravity and confident handling.
Light-Weight Offset Split 5-Spoke Wheels
19-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels that give the bike a custom look, easy-steering and a better power to weight ratio.

The break in period was done correctly and I made sure to vary the rpms. First service was done and all restrictions were removed at the dealer along with an oil change. I have all of the records. I tastefully added a few aftermarket parts and a tune from brentuning that removes the horrible restrictive factory tune and frees up the bike considerably. Never laid down or scratched anywhere. Has approximately 2500 miles. Ive owned motorcycles and dirt bikes most of my life and am mechanically inclined and take really good care of them. Never abused or neglected. Really hate to sell it but I purchased a new car and this has to go. Always garaged, never left outside. I will throw in Arai Corsair X Isle of Man TT helmet XL that is like new as well as a leather riding jacket and a few summer jackets, few pairs of leather gloves and other gear I may have all valued at over $2500 if purchased for asking price. No low balls, no trades, no test rides without cash in hand. This is a great deal considering the aftermarket parts and gear it comes with it. Clean title. Email if serious or have questions.

NEW STREET TRIPLE R
Like the Street Triple, but harder.
It's a tough looking, higher spec version of the Street Triple - not an easy task when the original is so impressive. A real challenge, but we've taken this bike to a new level of style and performance. Introducing the Street Triple R.
Fitted with fully adjustable front and rear suspension, Nissin 4-piston radial front calipers and radial master cylinder, parts normally found in the supersports category.
The upside down forks are anodized black to compliment an aggressive new Matt Graphite paint scheme with distinctive orange ""R"" graphics and two-tone black and grey stitched seat. With Magura tapered aluminum handlebars, it's not a bike for those who do subtle, more for those who take things to the max.

This was a barn find in Ashford Washington, and the bike had not been ridden in 12 years or so. The bike was stripped to the bare frame, which was sandblasted and powder coated by Seattle Powder Coat. The restoration includes:
- Engine rebuild, including
- Heads rebuild by Ted Porter with new valves, seats, and springs.
- Cylinders were honed, new rings installed.
- New Wedgetail electronic ignition.
- New Enduralast III charging system.
- New Enduralast starter.

- Final drive rebuilt.
- Gas tank thoroughly cleaned, treated with rust converter, and resealed with epoxy coating.

We love this competition green/fusion white color on the 2018 Triumph Bonneville T120 that just landed on consignment, looking for a new home. It was well loved and will be missed, but now that the world is spinning at full speed, time off just to go enjoy the pleasure of cruising have gotten fewer and fewer.  We have known the owner since 2017 and have taken care of a couple of their moto's over the years including this T120.  We appreciate the opportunity, this one is in great condition, well taken care of and ready for more adventures. .  When it came in we gave it a good safety inspection, everything checked out great, it was decided to perform the factory recommended annual service, and it received a full detail.  There are a few nice add-on's we spotted like the Dart windscreen, rear chrome rack and the very cool Moto Gadget m-view mirrors, we do have the stock ones as well that come with.   Little detail, we noticed the ""artists"" initials at the back of the hand striped fuel tank!

We have every service record since new, owner's manual, Triumph owner satchel, both factory keys and a clean WA title.  The last T120 we had in was August 2022, lasted all of 4 days before sold.

PRESS

Inspired by the legendary 1959 Bonneville and styled to incorporate the original’s iconic features, the Bonneville T120 reaches a whole new level of detailing, quality and finish — including deep chrome multi-piece Triumph tank badges, grab rail and innovative twin-skinned chrome exhaust headers and peashooter style silencers. Powered by an all new ‘high-torque’ engine and fed by beautiful authentic twin throttle bodies, the 1200cc power plant is specifically built for this modern classic.

Hop aboard the Bonneville T120, and immediately you’ll notice the 31-inch-high, well-cushioned, rib-stitched seat, and relaxed, nearly upright riding position. Footpegs are almost directly under the seat, keeping knees bent, but far from fetal position. Handlebars are angled a little back and up, minimizing torso lean, but still hinting at a bit of sportiness. The newly designed chassis with a tubular steel cradle and a twin-sided tubular steel swingarm makes the T120 feel low and slim. At 494 pounds dry, this 1,200cc Bonnie carries its weight low, making parking lot maneuvers manageable.

The stunning Bonneville T120 is a stylish and distinctive statement of Triumphs heritage. Combining the modern performance of the Bonneville 1200cc high torque engine with authentic styling, crafted to follow the silhouette and cues of the original Bonneville, the T120 is a timeless icon beautifully evolved.

Financing available O.A.C. - Cash Price listed, up to a $200.00 documentation fee may be charged

I purchased this bike with 8600 miles on it, our shop went through the machine and made it ready for a good customer/friend who took his wife on their “trip of a lifetime” this summer and brought it back to me to resell as he doesn’t need a bike this large here in Washington. We installed a new set of Dunlop American elites just a few thousand miles ago. The bike has a chrome front end and a stage two kit along with a quick detach kit for the trunk! Other than a few scratches on the faring that have been touched up the spike looks as a motorcycle with only 10,000 miles should look!
And then, there is the paint… Harley Davidson jade green sun glow is a beauty to behold in the sunlight! You must see and ride this bike to appreciate it! Don’t miss out…

2022 CFMoto 700CL-X
RIDE A MOMENT
The 700CL-X is not just a motorcycle, it's a statement. To some it says classic design. To others it says modern technology. To you, its intended rider, it'll say so much more. That story will become evident when you ignite the 693cc powerplant and experience this street-smart example of engineering wizardry firsthand. If riding is your thing, we're betting this thing of beauty has already won you over.
Features may include:
The 700CL-X isn't just a dream bike. It's a real bike at an unreal price built to deliver a riding experience without compromise. Every part of it is as good as it looks. The engine is as good as it sounds. The brakes are as good as they grip. The suspension is as good as it responds. It's the whole package. And as you can see, it is quite remarkable.
Ride Modes, Cruise Control, Auto-Canceling Turn Signals
The round, classic-style LCD gauge provides clear riding information. The on-board computer brings you two, on-the-fly riding modes: Sport and Economy. For those long, open stretches, one-touch cruise control takes a load off your wrist while auto-canceling turn signals take a load off your mind.
Design
Enjoy a fresh take on a classic style with the 700CL-X's eye-catching angles and retro styling. The bike features a cafe racer headlight, fuel tank aluminum side panels, a leather seat, spoke-like alloy wheels, and high-performance Pirelli tires.
LED Lights
Lighting is one of the most important safety features of your motorcycle. Full LED lighting with a signature DRL (daytime running light) & taillight includes an automatic headlight and turn signal system. You're not just lighting the way. You're a beacon on the road for others to see.
Customizable Appearance
When it comes to owning your identity, we've made it easy to show off your true self. Available in Coal Gray and Twilight Blue, the 700CL-X can be customized with changeable modular bodywork, giving you the flexibility to embrace your style and showcase your creativity.
Ergonomics
You'll enjoy a comfortable and relaxed riding experience thanks to a 31.5 seat height and upright handlebars. The low center of gravity makes it remarkably easy to handle, even after a full day in the saddle.
Lightweight
The newly designed split frame and aluminum swingarm bring the curb weight of the 700CL-X down to 432 lbs., resulting in a high power-to-weight ratio and more responsive handling.

PRESS:
The brand-new, redesigned 2011 GSX-R750™ is the latest version of the original GSX-R - the championship-winning sport bike that is literally in a class of its own. While the unrivaled GSX-R750's only challenge is outdoing itself, the all-new 2011 model responds with bold styling and exceptional performance. On the road or on the track, the 2011 GSX-R750 delivers a riding experience that is a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, swift handling, compact size and light weight. The key to the GSX-R750's racetrack-conquering speed and agile handling is the pairing of its powerful inline four-cylinder, 16-valve 750 cubic centimeter engine into the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600 cubic centimeter Supersport. It's a winning combination that will allow any rider to experience the exhilarating rush of a middleweight AMA Supersport bike.

Beneath all that classic style and those heritage-rich details, there's an outrageous spirit lurking deep in the heart of the Road King®. And here it is, rearing its glorious chrome and sheet metal head. The Road King Custom. This ride is brand new, but the style might remind you of the custom bikes native to California beaches. The kind that grab attention like a bull in a china shop. Note the pullback beach bars, lowered rear suspension, clean leather bags with hidden supports and slash-cut mufflers. It's got nickel-formed and chrome-plated tank emblems, a chrome wind-swept visor and bold, simple fenders over cast and chromed wheels. Even with all that boulevard styling, the Custom is made to go far. Air-adjustable rear suspension, refined chassis design and proven Twin Cam 88® engine, in carb or EFI. Check it out. It's Road King, in its most radical form. Availability of colors may vary from dealer to dealer, and is subject to change without notice. Pearl: additional $250

To use the maximum displacement for its class, the stroke grew from 40 to 40.8 mm and a displacement of 64.85 cc. An aluminum kick-starter instead of the former steel lever saves weight and a new joint makes it easier to operate. To save more weight, the ignition cover is also made of aluminum. The 65SX is now equipped with a state of the art digital ignition.

CUSTOM SABRE CHOPPER
Nothing's As Sharp As a Sabre® How do you classify a bike as sharp as the Honda Sabre? Pro Street dragster or boulevard bad boy - the Sabre offers a heaping dose of both. It's a sleek, modern-day custom, that's for sure. Taking a cue from the stripped-down styling of the Fury™, it goes on to carve out its own, very unique place in the Honda Custom lineup. Just check out the crisp, clean lines, sporty, minimalist fenders, tall, 21-inch front tire, raked-out fork and low, aggressively set bars. And let's not forget the brawny 1,312 cc 52° V-twin engine responsible for putting all this wickedly cool style in motion.

2023 Husqvarna FX 350 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new FX 350 engine is designed to deliver maximum performance. For 2023, the repositioning of all major engine components and shaft arrangements enhances overall handling with the design improving anti-squat behaviour from the whole chassis. The engine is tilted two degrees backwards and is 8 mm shorter in height to further centralise mass. Weighing just 59.9 lb (27.2 kilograms), the new 350cc 4-stroke engine produces a higher and more usable power output.
Ride easier
Frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023 to reposition rotational masses inside the engine which together with a new shock mounting position, significantly improves anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high-stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the standard skid plate.
03. Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
The bodywork clearly showcases Husqvarna Motorcycles' progressive approach to offroad motorcycles while the Swedish heritage-inspired blue and yellow graphics create a distinctive look. The ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
CNC-machined hubs and high-strength alloy rims by EXCEL are finished in striking black. They feature laser engraved logos and are fitted with a DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 tyre on the front and DUNLOP GEOMAX AT81 tyre on the rear which ensure progressive cornering and superior traction on a variety of terrain.
Technologically advanced
Map select switch
A redesigned and intuitive handlebar-mounted map select switch allows riders to activate launch and traction control, and allows riders to toggle between two engine maps. The easy-to-operate map select switch allows racers to quickly alter and set up the engine characteristics on a race by race basis dependent on track conditions and rider preference.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 Husqvarna Norden 901
The Norden 901 is an exceptional adventure touring motorcycle. Powered by a smooth and torquey 889 cc parallel twin engine, which is housed within a lightweight steel trellis frame, it is the complete long-distance travel machine. On road and when ridden across rugged terrain, the Norden 901 excels on every adventure. With premium, high performance offroad suspension, versatile tyres that deliver traction in all conditions, it features ergonomics that ensure enhanced comfort for extended ride times. Explore the world your way with the Norden 901.
Features may include:
Adventure in its core
Geometry
Wherever you plan to go or wherever your inner north navigation takes you, the chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame is designed for distance able to take the load and deliver day-long comfort. By using the engine as a stressed member, the frame can be light and compact. Engineered to deliver precise feedback with agility and light-handling through the tightest bends, it provides stability and comfort over distance and superior offroad ability on the less-travelled tracks. Although it is compact and light, the frame is as tough as any challenge you give it, carrying luggage, a passenger or both anywhere from the street to the most remote trail. The geometry of the Norden 901 was developed to create a world class travel motorcycle for every voyage of discovery. Seat height is manageable for every adventurer thanks to an angled rear shock. The ergonomics place you towards the front wheel for better feel and grip on all surfaces.
Trustworthy equipment
Suspension
Control and comfort rank high on your list of demands from the Norden 901. With 220 mm of travel, the WP APEX 43 mm upside-down front forks deliver next-level performance and comfort in every environment, whether that means taut handling on tarmac or smoothing the way offroad. You can quickly and easily vary the ride characteristics to suit your own preference and varying conditions thanks to the adjustability of the compression and rebound damping of the forks. Likewise, the WP APEX rear shock offers a generous 215 mm of travel, and is adjustable for rebound damping and spring preload to cater for the roads you ride and the loads you carry. Adjusting the settings is quick and easy, so that when conditions change, you can set the suspension to match them. With comfort and control from compliant suspension, there are less limits to the distance your travels take you.
Engine
Every twist of the ride-by-wire throttle delivers just the right amount of power you require to reach new horizons. A pair of balancer shafts in the 889 cc, double overhead cam, liquid cooled, parallel twin engine increase comfort and reduce vibration, adding to your riding pleasure. The engine has plentiful power, with a maximum output at 8,000 rpm and peak torque at 6,500 rpm. This, combined with finesse and manageability, make the engine capable of delivering everything you demand of it, wherever you want to go. Long service intervals of 15,000 km and low fuel consumption make the Norden 901's engine even better suited to the tasks you set for it.

2023 KTM 1290 Super Adventure R
Pick a point on a map, drop a pin, and hit the road. The KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R is engineered to cross the wildest, most challenging terrain with unmatched ability and class-leading performance. It leaves us saying only one thing - Uncharted territory beware! The KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R is primed and ready to plant its flag anywhere on the planet.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
With a sledgehammer hit of power and earth-twisting torque, the proven V-twin LC8 engine once again takes the accolades as the most compact, lightest, and best performing engine in the segment. Its greener too, and will deliver 15,000 km service intervals and low fuel consumption, trip after trip, mile after mile.
CHASSIS
Frame
A new, reworked, and lightweight, chrome-molybdenum stainless steel trellis frame featuring laser-cut tubes, combines with forged elements for an ultra-strong component on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R. The steering head has been moved 15 mm rearwards, to shorten the overall frame for improved cornering behavior, while the front engine mount has been rotated forward by 2 degrees to aid in hard acceleration, keeping the front end firmly planted on the ground.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
Wide, adjustable, and ready for long hours in the saddle, the high-strength tapered aluminum handlebars are designed to provide riders with greater control, and uncompromised comfort. Newly developed and robust handguards have also been designed for optimal aerodynamic behavior when it comes to high-speed stability.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
LED headlight
Turning night into day, the LED headlight on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R has been designed to light the way on any adventure. Flanked by cornering and day time running lights. This results in a clean, KTM-distinctive look which provides impeccable illumination with a wide beam pattern to light up the road ahead.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Taking charge at the helm is an all-new scratch-resistant 7-inch TFT display. Unmatched in terms of graphics and readability, adventurers can access information and make adjustments to the bike's semi-active suspension on the fly, quickly and easily without navigating complex menus. This comes thanks to a 6-way switch cube on the handlebar. Connectivity is also taken care of by way of KTMconnect, which connects via Bluetooth for TURN-BY-TURN Plus navigation, playing music, and even answering incoming calls. Still catching glare? The TFT screen is tilt-angle adjustable.

2023 Husqvarna FC 350 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Powerful engine
The FC 450 engine benefits from advanced engineering techniques to deliver maximum performance. For 2023 the engine is lighter, weighing just 59 lb, and is tilted two degrees backwards to further centralise mass for enhanced handling and significantly improved anti-squat behaviour from the chassis. Servicing of the FC 450 engine is made easier compared to previous models thanks to the addition of service markers on the engine cases.
Ride easier
Lightweight frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023. A new shock mounting, which is no longer connected to the main tube, significantly improves the anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate, which is available as a technical accessory.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A flat seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip, ribbed seat cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
Assembled with CNC-machined hubs, strong spokes, and black-anodised alloy rims by EXCEL, the wheels of the FC 450 are fitted with DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 Motocross tyres which feature a proven block-within-a-block design for more progressive cornering and superior grip. For increased traction and stability through ruts, the FC 450 is fitted with a 120/90-19 rear tyre while a 80/100-21 front tyre ensures optimal grip on a variety of riding surfaces.
Technologically advanced
Map select switch
A redesigned and intuitive handlebar-mounted map select switch allows riders to activate launch and traction control, enable the new Quickshift functionality, and allows riders to toggle between two engine maps. The easy-to-operate map select switch allows racers to quickly alter and set up the engine characteristics on a race by race basis dependent on track conditions and rider preference.

Brand new plastic, brake pads, and has had a complete inspection!
2019 Honda CRF250R
HOLESHOTS, PLUS.
The 250 motocross class just might be the most competitive in all of racing. If you give an inch on the track, there are 20 or 30 other guys waiting to eat your lunch and use you for traction. First lesson: Winning starts with the holeshot, and getting the holeshot is where Honda's CRF250R excels. We gave it an all-new DOHC engine last year, and this year we've continued with upgrades and refinements. Lesson number two: Hold on to the lead once you've got it. On a 250 this can be tough, especially in the slower corners. No problem on a 2019 CRF250R we've made specific improvements in power delivery to give you that critical edge in the tight stuff. The open-class guys can just point and shoot here, but on a 250 that's where a race is won and lost, by inches. So use every advantage you have, because you know what? There's going to be someone else on the starting line riding a 2019 CRF250R, and if you're not, you'll end up behind them.
Features may include:
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF250R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
The CRF250R is equipped with an effortless electric starter. Convenient and lightweight, it's a huge deal if you need to restart a stalled bike in the heat of battle.
NEW DOUBLE-SPRAY INJECTOR SETTINGS
The CRF250R's fuel-injection system sprays twice per intake cycle. That helps increase fuel atomization without adding the weight or complexity of a second injector. The better fuel atomization means more power in the midrange and on over rev you'll feel it the first time you race.
SHOWA SPRING FORK
The 49mm Showa fork features a conventional spring design that helps increase the CRF250R's front-suspension precision, handling and feel. The 39mm piston diameter and 25mm rod diameter guarantee a plush feel and supple action.

Comments for this 2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM:
Here now! Fun Fun!
2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM
Suzuki's 2022 SuperMoto DR-Z400SM is based on the proven DR-Z400S. So it combines Supermotard style and features in a narrow, lightweight, street-legal package. This bike brings off-road soul and fun to paved roads. It's not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.
Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide, spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor. The inverted fork contributes to less unsprung weight and improved overall handling, while the large brake and wider rims with high-grip tires offer an exhilarating sportbike experience.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Lightweight, 398cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, dry-sump engine produces strong, tractable power.
Compact, four-valve cylinder head has 36mm intake valves, 29mm exhaust valves, narrow 28-degree included valve angle, and shim-under-bucket valve adjustment system.
Simple electric starting is powered via a lightweight starter motor with an automatic mechanical decompression system.
TRANSMISSION
Compact, five-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with a separate magnesium outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance.
Low-maintenance, long-life, sealed O-ring type drive chain produces minimal sounds when riding.
CHASSIS
Wide, black-anodized RK Excel aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes are fitted with sporty radial tires: 120/70-R17 front and 140/70-R17 rear.
Strong braking performance is supplied by a front disc brake with a large 300mm floating-type rotor and dual-piston caliper, plus a 240mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper.
Long travel, Showa inverted front fork is derived from the RM250 and features adjustable compression/rebound damping and a special coating on inner tube surfaces for smooth action.
ELECTRICAL
Compact, digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.
ADDITIONAL
12-month unlimited mileage limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP).*
A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for DR-Z400SM owners are available, including a low-profile seat, cargo rack, handguard set, and a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.

2019 Honda CRF450R
LAUNCH. HOLESHOT. PODIUM.
Heat after heat, race after race, Honda's CRF450R is hooking up riders like never before. If there's ever a machine that's given you an almost uncanny holeshot advantage, this is it. And for 2019, we've taken this awesome open-classer and made it even better. How? For starters, it's even lighter. Then there's an all-new chassis and swingarm, designed to work together for increased traction and cornering. The engine features longer head pipes for better throttle response and top-end pull. New fuel-injection settings spray twice per cycle to better atomize the fuel. And for the first time ever, there's a special launch-control setting, so it's easier than ever to grab the holeshot and hang on to your lead. What else is new? Plenty. The 2019 CRF450R better than ever.
Looking for the ultimate 450? Then check out our new CRF450R Works Edition. You get all the improvements of this year's bike plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID LT-X rims, exclusive Yoshimura mufflers, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and full-on HRC decals. The only thing missing is a factory contract!
Features may include:
NEXT-GENERATION ALUMINUM FRAME
The CRF450R's Next-Gen twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock's mounting point lower, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity for more holeshots. The frame geometry also helps improve traction, feeling and steering precision.
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF450R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
Kickstarting your bike is so 2016. By ditching the kickstarter entirely, our engineers can make the CRF450R lighter. Electric starters and lithium-ion batteries are so light now and so good that putting them on a bike like this is a win/win combination. And winning is what a CRF450R is all about.
ALL-NEW WORKS EDITION
Homologated for racing and available in limited numbers, the CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the improvements of this year's CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID LT-X rims, exclusive Yoshimura mufflers, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and an HRC decal package.

An iconic V-Twin engine that is renowned for its massive low-end torque and soul-satisfying sound. Lightweight aluminum heads and cylinders improve air-cooling efficiency.
Blacked-Out Styling
There’s plenty of black to bring a dark edge to the garage-built look of the Roadster™ motorcycle. The mirrors, belt guard and headlamp are black. The oval air cleaner has a black insert. There are slotted black exhaust shields and a blacked-out powertrain.
Slammed Handlebars and New Gauge
You get the performance look and feel of slammed handlebars that put you in an aggressive riding position. And the gauge includes a speedometer and tach so you can keep track of what’s going on in your power plant.

Comments for this 2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM:
Here now! Fun Fun!
2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM
Suzuki's 2022 SuperMoto DR-Z400SM is based on the proven DR-Z400S. So it combines Supermotard style and features in a narrow, lightweight, street-legal package. This bike brings off-road soul and fun to paved roads. It's not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.
Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide, spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor. The inverted fork contributes to less unsprung weight and improved overall handling, while the large brake and wider rims with high-grip tires offer an exhilarating sportbike experience.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Lightweight, 398cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, dry-sump engine produces strong, tractable power.
Compact, four-valve cylinder head has 36mm intake valves, 29mm exhaust valves, narrow 28-degree included valve angle, and shim-under-bucket valve adjustment system.
Simple electric starting is powered via a lightweight starter motor with an automatic mechanical decompression system.
TRANSMISSION
Compact, five-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with a separate magnesium outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance.
Low-maintenance, long-life, sealed O-ring type drive chain produces minimal sounds when riding.
CHASSIS
Wide, black-anodized RK Excel aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes are fitted with sporty radial tires: 120/70-R17 front and 140/70-R17 rear.
Strong braking performance is supplied by a front disc brake with a large 300mm floating-type rotor and dual-piston caliper, plus a 240mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper.
Long travel, Showa inverted front fork is derived from the RM250 and features adjustable compression/rebound damping and a special coating on inner tube surfaces for smooth action.
ELECTRICAL
Compact, digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.
ADDITIONAL
12-month unlimited mileage limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP).*
A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for DR-Z400SM owners are available, including a low-profile seat, cargo rack, handguard set, and a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
The ULTIMATE woods bike is back in stock... Who wants it?
2023 KTM 300 XC-W Erzbergrodeo
Named after the Iron Giant itself, the 2023 KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO sits atop the throne of the extreme enduro kingdom. Based on the wildly capable and unmatched KTM 300 XC-W, it brings a new level of extreme to the fore. Sporting a hardcore, READY TO RACE parts list and commemorative graphics set, it is 100% built for the purpose of conquering the world's most extreme enduro race. You could even say, then, that the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO rules the roost.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
A legend in its own right, the KTM 300 cc 2-stroke engine has long been a favorite when it comes to enduro weaponry. This is largely down to its exceptional power, low-down torque and overall light weight. Thanks to state-of-the-art engineering, innovative 2-stroke design, and revolutionary TPI fuel injection technology, this powerplant has become a truly refined unit.
Cylinder
The cylinder on the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO has a bore of 72 mm and is fitted with a sophisticated power valve, providing ultra-smooth and controllable power characteristics. Being fuel-injected, the cylinder features two lateral domes which hold the fuel injectors, supplying fuel to the rear transfer ports. The downstream injection guarantees excellent atomization of the fuel with the upstreaming air. Thus, the loss of unburnt fuel is minimal for fewer emissions, more efficient combustion, and reduced fuel consumption. The cylinder also features a state-of-the-art power valve unit with a sophisticated mechanism for the lateral support exhaust ports. The exhaust port layout increases engine performance, while the upper contour of the exhaust port has been machined to ensure more accurate port timing.
CHASSIS
Frame
The KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO features a high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frame, finished in a striking and durable orange powder coating. Sporting race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider, the KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO is rock-steady at speed, while providing unmatched agility and maneuverability in the extra rough stuff.
Swingarm
The KTM 300 XC-W ERZBERGRODEO features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exeptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XC-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip. Addionally, the KTM 300 XC-W TPI ERZBERGRODEO is equipped with a handlebar map select switch, which lets you select between a standard and advanced power curve.
Seat
Tailored to meet the needs of the world's fastest backsides, this durable seat offers great comfort, helping you master the most challenging terrain all day long.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Footpegs
Sophisticated ?No-Dirt? footpegs prevent clogging up the pegs, even when digging in deep ruts. The pegs on the Enduro models are 6 mm higher than the ones used on SX models, which benefits ground clearance. But you can swap them at will.

2023 Honda GROM
GROM-IT!
The Honda Grom is one of the most popular motorcycles on the planet, and one ride will tell you why. And even when you're not riding one, a Grom is just fun to own. They're a vehicle for self expression in so many different ways. But what always stays the same is the dependability and quality you can count on with every Honda and every Grom. That starts with the 124cc electric-start engine. Fuel injection and a 10:1 compression ratio contribute to the awesome fuel efficiency a crazy-good 166 miles per gallon!* A five-speed transmission works just like a bigger motorcycle's for excellent performance. And the plug-and-play body panels are easy to remove if you want to add some custom graphics of your own it's like a blank canvas that you can ride. There's even a version with optional anti-lock brakes. Hey, everyone has someplace to go why not have fun doing it? Get there on a Grom.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
124cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINE
Nobody can match our reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it's a giant in terms of performance and reliability.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
At just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the seat features thick padding so it's comfortable, especially for taller riders.
ENGINEERING
HYDRAULIC DISC BRAKES
The Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.
STYLE
UNIQUE BODYWORK
Part of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. Plus, its unique bodywork is easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.
LED HEADLIGHT
The Grom's LED projector-style headlight not only looks great and is a major styling element, but it also provides excellent illumination.

The engine combines powerful acceleration from the very lowest revs with an outstanding free-revving nature and refined engine running. Another big plus: It's extremely economical with fuel.
Cylinder Head
A lightweight, compact cylinder head contains four valves and a single camshaft placed over the intake valves, with a secondary balancer shaft driven by the timing chain. The intake valves are actuated by finger followers and the exhaust valves by a rocker arm.
Exhaust
The KTM 690 ENDURO R features a specifically developed exhaust system made from the highest-quality stainless steel, which is not only compact and optimized for offroad use, it is emissions compliant too.
CHASSIS
MASTER THE RIDE
Frame
The trellis frame is manufactured from lightweight sections of top-quality chrome-molybdenum steel tubing of varying thicknesses. This type of balanced frame design provides high torsional rigidity for best handling and rideability, while a more specifically-tuned longitudinal flexibility can absorb the wheel impact energy, supporting the suspension for reduced rider fatigue.
Subframe
The innovative use of the rear fuel tank as the main structural element of the subframe, keeps weight low and eliminates design complexity.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
The lightweight tapered 808 mm wide handlebars are rubber mounted to reduce vibrations. Their width and shape are aimed at providing maximum control in all situations.
Footpegs
Sophisticated No Dirt foot pegs prevent jamming up of the pegs, even when digging your way through deep ruts or navigating wet terrain. Rubber inserts can be mounted for street use to help reduce any vibration that might be felt through the pegs on smooth roads.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Keeping true to its enduro roots, the KTM 690 ENDURO R sports a simple, but effective dashboard. Providing riders with essential information its slimline design keeps the view forward clear of any obstructions. After all, when you're blasting across challenging terrain, you don't want any distractions.
Rider aids
Electronic fuel injection, ride-by-wire and the engine management system (EMS) make it possible to offer innovative yet easy-to-use electronic rider aids. These features can be selected, deselected and utilized to put the potent new-generation LC4 motor to effective use in a much wider range of terrain types and conditions.

Roadster™
The new Roadster™ motorcycle combines stoplight-to-stoplight power, agility and garage-built custom style to shatter every mold.
PURE ADRENALINE MEETS GARAGE-BUILT CUSTOM STYLE
1200 cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
An iconic V-Twin engine that is renowned for its massive low-end torque and soul-satisfying sound. Lightweight aluminum heads and cylinders improve air-cooling efficiency.
Blacked-Out Styling
There’s plenty of black to bring a dark edge to the garage-built look of the Roadster™ motorcycle. The mirrors, belt guard and headlamp are black. The oval air cleaner has a black insert. There are slotted black exhaust shields and a blacked-out powertrain.
Slammed Handlebars and New Gauge
You get the performance look and feel of slammed handlebars that put you in an aggressive riding position. And the gauge includes a speedometer and tach so you can keep track of what’s going on in your power plant.
43mm Front Suspension with Inverted Forks
The 43 mm front suspension with inverted forks features cartridge damping and the brawny look of massive new triple clamps. They’ll keep your rubber on the road when the pavement gets rough.
Dual Disc Front Brakes with Floating Rotors
Dual disc front brakes with floating rotors so you can be more confident in your stopping with all that muscle behind you.
Aggressive and Comfortable Two-Up Seat
The optimal combination of comfort and custom style. It’s a low profile, two-up seat with a nice, deep scoop to keep you firmly planted under acceleration, and it puts you just 29.5 inches off the ground for a low center of gravity and confident handling.
Light-Weight Offset Split 5-Spoke Wheels
19-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels that give the bike a custom look, easy-steering and a better power to weight ratio.

No low balls, no trades, no test rides without cash in hand. This is a great deal considering the aftermarket parts and gear it comes with it. Clean title. Email if serious or have questions.

I do not need help selling, I am not interested in trades, I do not want a cashiers check from Nigeria.

I'm not interested in discussing what someone may like or dislike about BMW's or what they think motorcycles are worth. You can search Bringatrailer and look at what motorcycles are selling for and how rare the R80 g/s is

NEW STREET TRIPLE R
Like the Street Triple, but harder.
It's a tough looking, higher spec version of the Street Triple - not an easy task when the original is so impressive. A real challenge, but we've taken this bike to a new level of style and performance. Introducing the Street Triple R.
Fitted with fully adjustable front and rear suspension, Nissin 4-piston radial front calipers and radial master cylinder, parts normally found in the supersports category.
The upside down forks are anodized black to compliment an aggressive new Matt Graphite paint scheme with distinctive orange ""R"" graphics and two-tone black and grey stitched seat. With Magura tapered aluminum handlebars, it's not a bike for those who do subtle, more for those who take things to the max.

The bike was stripped to the bare frame, which was sandblasted and powder coated by Seattle Powder Coat. The restoration includes:

We love this competition green/fusion white color on the 2018 Triumph Bonneville T120 that just landed on consignment, looking for a new home. It was well loved and will be missed, but now that the world is spinning at full speed, time off just to go enjoy the pleasure of cruising have gotten fewer and fewer.  We have known the owner since 2017 and have taken care of a couple of their moto's over the years including this T120.  We appreciate the opportunity, this one is in great condition, well taken care of and ready for more adventures. .  When it came in we gave it a good safety inspection, everything checked out great, it was decided to perform the factory recommended annual service, and it received a full detail.  There are a few nice add-on's we spotted like the Dart windscreen, rear chrome rack and the very cool Moto Gadget m-view mirrors, we do have the stock ones as well that come with.   Little detail, we noticed the ""artists"" initials at the back of the hand striped fuel tank!

We have every service record since new, owner's manual, Triumph owner satchel, both factory keys and a clean WA title.  The last T120 we had in was August 2022, lasted all of 4 days before sold.

PRESS

Inspired by the legendary 1959 Bonneville and styled to incorporate the original’s iconic features, the Bonneville T120 reaches a whole new level of detailing, quality and finish — including deep chrome multi-piece Triumph tank badges, grab rail and innovative twin-skinned chrome exhaust headers and peashooter style silencers. Powered by an all new ‘high-torque’ engine and fed by beautiful authentic twin throttle bodies, the 1200cc power plant is specifically built for this modern classic.

Hop aboard the Bonneville T120, and immediately you’ll notice the 31-inch-high, well-cushioned, rib-stitched seat, and relaxed, nearly upright riding position. Footpegs are almost directly under the seat, keeping knees bent, but far from fetal position. Handlebars are angled a little back and up, minimizing torso lean, but still hinting at a bit of sportiness. The newly designed chassis with a tubular steel cradle and a twin-sided tubular steel swingarm makes the T120 feel low and slim. At 494 pounds dry, this 1,200cc Bonnie carries its weight low, making parking lot maneuvers manageable.

The stunning Bonneville T120 is a stylish and distinctive statement of Triumphs heritage. Combining the modern performance of the Bonneville 1200cc high torque engine with authentic styling, crafted to follow the silhouette and cues of the original Bonneville, the T120 is a timeless icon beautifully evolved.

I purchased this bike with 8600 miles on it, our shop went through the machine and made it ready for a good customer/friend who took his wife on their “trip of a lifetime” this summer and brought it back to me to resell as he doesn’t need a bike this large here in Washington. We installed a new set of Dunlop American elites just a few thousand miles ago. The bike has a chrome front end and a stage two kit along with a quick detach kit for the trunk! Other than a few scratches on the faring that have been touched up the spike looks as a motorcycle with only 10,000 miles should look!
And then, there is the paint… Harley Davidson jade green sun glow is a beauty to behold in the sunlight! You must see and ride this bike to appreciate it! Don’t miss out…

Only 30 minutes from Downtown Seattle on Super highway! It's a Beautiful ride or drive to North Bend.

2022 CFMoto 700CL-X
RIDE A MOMENT
The 700CL-X is not just a motorcycle, it's a statement. To some it says classic design. To others it says modern technology. To you, its intended rider, it'll say so much more. That story will become evident when you ignite the 693cc powerplant and experience this street-smart example of engineering wizardry firsthand. If riding is your thing, we're betting this thing of beauty has already won you over.
Features may include:
The 700CL-X isn't just a dream bike. It's a real bike at an unreal price built to deliver a riding experience without compromise. Every part of it is as good as it looks. The engine is as good as it sounds. The brakes are as good as they grip. The suspension is as good as it responds. It's the whole package. And as you can see, it is quite remarkable.
Ride Modes, Cruise Control, Auto-Canceling Turn Signals
The round, classic-style LCD gauge provides clear riding information. The on-board computer brings you two, on-the-fly riding modes: Sport and Economy. For those long, open stretches, one-touch cruise control takes a load off your wrist while auto-canceling turn signals take a load off your mind.
Design
Enjoy a fresh take on a classic style with the 700CL-X's eye-catching angles and retro styling. The bike features a cafe racer headlight, fuel tank aluminum side panels, a leather seat, spoke-like alloy wheels, and high-performance Pirelli tires.
LED Lights
Lighting is one of the most important safety features of your motorcycle. Full LED lighting with a signature DRL (daytime running light) & taillight includes an automatic headlight and turn signal system. You're not just lighting the way. You're a beacon on the road for others to see.
Customizable Appearance
When it comes to owning your identity, we've made it easy to show off your true self. Available in Coal Gray and Twilight Blue, the 700CL-X can be customized with changeable modular bodywork, giving you the flexibility to embrace your style and showcase your creativity.
Ergonomics
You'll enjoy a comfortable and relaxed riding experience thanks to a 31.5 seat height and upright handlebars. The low center of gravity makes it remarkably easy to handle, even after a full day in the saddle.
Lightweight
The newly designed split frame and aluminum swingarm bring the curb weight of the 700CL-X down to 432 lbs., resulting in a high power-to-weight ratio and more responsive handling.

PRESS:
The brand-new, redesigned 2011 GSX-R750™ is the latest version of the original GSX-R - the championship-winning sport bike that is literally in a class of its own. While the unrivaled GSX-R750's only challenge is outdoing itself, the all-new 2011 model responds with bold styling and exceptional performance. On the road or on the track, the 2011 GSX-R750 delivers a riding experience that is a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, swift handling, compact size and light weight. The key to the GSX-R750's racetrack-conquering speed and agile handling is the pairing of its powerful inline four-cylinder, 16-valve 750 cubic centimeter engine into the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600 cubic centimeter Supersport. It's a winning combination that will allow any rider to experience the exhilarating rush of a middleweight AMA Supersport bike.

Beneath all that classic style and those heritage-rich details, there's an outrageous spirit lurking deep in the heart of the Road King®. And here it is, rearing its glorious chrome and sheet metal head. The Road King Custom. This ride is brand new, but the style might remind you of the custom bikes native to California beaches. The kind that grab attention like a bull in a china shop. Note the pullback beach bars, lowered rear suspension, clean leather bags with hidden supports and slash-cut mufflers. It's got nickel-formed and chrome-plated tank emblems, a chrome wind-swept visor and bold, simple fenders over cast and chromed wheels. Even with all that boulevard styling, the Custom is made to go far. Air-adjustable rear suspension, refined chassis design and proven Twin Cam 88® engine, in carb or EFI. Check it out. It's Road King, in its most radical form. Availability of colors may vary from dealer to dealer, and is subject to change without notice. Pearl: additional $250

To use the maximum displacement for its class, the stroke grew from 40 to 40.8 mm and a displacement of 64.85 cc. An aluminum kick-starter instead of the former steel lever saves weight and a new joint makes it easier to operate. To save more weight, the ignition cover is also made of aluminum. The 65SX is now equipped with a state of the art digital ignition.

CUSTOM SABRE CHOPPER
Nothing's As Sharp As a Sabre® How do you classify a bike as sharp as the Honda Sabre? Pro Street dragster or boulevard bad boy - the Sabre offers a heaping dose of both. It's a sleek, modern-day custom, that's for sure. Taking a cue from the stripped-down styling of the Fury™, it goes on to carve out its own, very unique place in the Honda Custom lineup. Just check out the crisp, clean lines, sporty, minimalist fenders, tall, 21-inch front tire, raked-out fork and low, aggressively set bars. And let's not forget the brawny 1,312 cc 52° V-twin engine responsible for putting all this wickedly cool style in motion.

2023 Husqvarna FX 350 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new FX 350 engine is designed to deliver maximum performance. For 2023, the repositioning of all major engine components and shaft arrangements enhances overall handling with the design improving anti-squat behaviour from the whole chassis. The engine is tilted two degrees backwards and is 8 mm shorter in height to further centralise mass. Weighing just 59.9 lb (27.2 kilograms), the new 350cc 4-stroke engine produces a higher and more usable power output.
Ride easier
Frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023 to reposition rotational masses inside the engine which together with a new shock mounting position, significantly improves anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high-stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the standard skid plate.
03. Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
The bodywork clearly showcases Husqvarna Motorcycles' progressive approach to offroad motorcycles while the Swedish heritage-inspired blue and yellow graphics create a distinctive look. The ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
CNC-machined hubs and high-strength alloy rims by EXCEL are finished in striking black. They feature laser engraved logos and are fitted with a DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 tyre on the front and DUNLOP GEOMAX AT81 tyre on the rear which ensure progressive cornering and superior traction on a variety of terrain.
Technologically advanced
Map select switch
A redesigned and intuitive handlebar-mounted map select switch allows riders to activate launch and traction control, and allows riders to toggle between two engine maps. The easy-to-operate map select switch allows racers to quickly alter and set up the engine characteristics on a race by race basis dependent on track conditions and rider preference.

2023 Husqvarna Norden 901
The Norden 901 is an exceptional adventure touring motorcycle. Powered by a smooth and torquey 889 cc parallel twin engine, which is housed within a lightweight steel trellis frame, it is the complete long-distance travel machine. On road and when ridden across rugged terrain, the Norden 901 excels on every adventure. With premium, high performance offroad suspension, versatile tyres that deliver traction in all conditions, it features ergonomics that ensure enhanced comfort for extended ride times. Explore the world your way with the Norden 901.
Features may include:
Adventure in its core
Geometry
Wherever you plan to go or wherever your inner north navigation takes you, the chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame is designed for distance able to take the load and deliver day-long comfort. By using the engine as a stressed member, the frame can be light and compact. Engineered to deliver precise feedback with agility and light-handling through the tightest bends, it provides stability and comfort over distance and superior offroad ability on the less-travelled tracks. Although it is compact and light, the frame is as tough as any challenge you give it, carrying luggage, a passenger or both anywhere from the street to the most remote trail. The geometry of the Norden 901 was developed to create a world class travel motorcycle for every voyage of discovery. Seat height is manageable for every adventurer thanks to an angled rear shock. The ergonomics place you towards the front wheel for better feel and grip on all surfaces.
Trustworthy equipment
Suspension
Control and comfort rank high on your list of demands from the Norden 901. With 220 mm of travel, the WP APEX 43 mm upside-down front forks deliver next-level performance and comfort in every environment, whether that means taut handling on tarmac or smoothing the way offroad. You can quickly and easily vary the ride characteristics to suit your own preference and varying conditions thanks to the adjustability of the compression and rebound damping of the forks. Likewise, the WP APEX rear shock offers a generous 215 mm of travel, and is adjustable for rebound damping and spring preload to cater for the roads you ride and the loads you carry. Adjusting the settings is quick and easy, so that when conditions change, you can set the suspension to match them. With comfort and control from compliant suspension, there are less limits to the distance your travels take you.
Engine
Every twist of the ride-by-wire throttle delivers just the right amount of power you require to reach new horizons. A pair of balancer shafts in the 889 cc, double overhead cam, liquid cooled, parallel twin engine increase comfort and reduce vibration, adding to your riding pleasure. The engine has plentiful power, with a maximum output at 8,000 rpm and peak torque at 6,500 rpm. This, combined with finesse and manageability, make the engine capable of delivering everything you demand of it, wherever you want to go. Long service intervals of 15,000 km and low fuel consumption make the Norden 901's engine even better suited to the tasks you set for it.

2023 KTM 1290 Super Adventure R
Pick a point on a map, drop a pin, and hit the road. The KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R is engineered to cross the wildest, most challenging terrain with unmatched ability and class-leading performance. It leaves us saying only one thing - Uncharted territory beware! The KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R is primed and ready to plant its flag anywhere on the planet.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
With a sledgehammer hit of power and earth-twisting torque, the proven V-twin LC8 engine once again takes the accolades as the most compact, lightest, and best performing engine in the segment. Its greener too, and will deliver 15,000 km service intervals and low fuel consumption, trip after trip, mile after mile.
CHASSIS
Frame
A new, reworked, and lightweight, chrome-molybdenum stainless steel trellis frame featuring laser-cut tubes, combines with forged elements for an ultra-strong component on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R. The steering head has been moved 15 mm rearwards, to shorten the overall frame for improved cornering behavior, while the front engine mount has been rotated forward by 2 degrees to aid in hard acceleration, keeping the front end firmly planted on the ground.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
Wide, adjustable, and ready for long hours in the saddle, the high-strength tapered aluminum handlebars are designed to provide riders with greater control, and uncompromised comfort. Newly developed and robust handguards have also been designed for optimal aerodynamic behavior when it comes to high-speed stability.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
LED headlight
Turning night into day, the LED headlight on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R has been designed to light the way on any adventure. Flanked by cornering and day time running lights. This results in a clean, KTM-distinctive look which provides impeccable illumination with a wide beam pattern to light up the road ahead.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Taking charge at the helm is an all-new scratch-resistant 7-inch TFT display. Unmatched in terms of graphics and readability, adventurers can access information and make adjustments to the bike's semi-active suspension on the fly, quickly and easily without navigating complex menus. This comes thanks to a 6-way switch cube on the handlebar. Connectivity is also taken care of by way of KTMconnect, which connects via Bluetooth for TURN-BY-TURN Plus navigation, playing music, and even answering incoming calls. Still catching glare? The TFT screen is tilt-angle adjustable.

Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Powerful engine
The FC 450 engine benefits from advanced engineering techniques to deliver maximum performance. For 2023 the engine is lighter, weighing just 59 lb, and is tilted two degrees backwards to further centralise mass for enhanced handling and significantly improved anti-squat behaviour from the chassis. Servicing of the FC 450 engine is made easier compared to previous models thanks to the addition of service markers on the engine cases.
Ride easier
Lightweight frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023. A new shock mounting, which is no longer connected to the main tube, significantly improves the anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate, which is available as a technical accessory.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A flat seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip, ribbed seat cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
Assembled with CNC-machined hubs, strong spokes, and black-anodised alloy rims by EXCEL, the wheels of the FC 450 are fitted with DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 Motocross tyres which feature a proven block-within-a-block design for more progressive cornering and superior grip. For increased traction and stability through ruts, the FC 450 is fitted with a 120/90-19 rear tyre while a 80/100-21 front tyre ensures optimal grip on a variety of riding surfaces.
Technologically advanced
Map select switch
A redesigned and intuitive handlebar-mounted map select switch allows riders to activate launch and traction control, enable the new Quickshift functionality, and allows riders to toggle between two engine maps. The easy-to-operate map select switch allows racers to quickly alter and set up the engine characteristics on a race by race basis dependent on track conditions and rider preference.

Brand new plastic, brake pads, and has had a complete inspection!
2019 Honda CRF250R
HOLESHOTS, PLUS.
The 250 motocross class just might be the most competitive in all of racing. If you give an inch on the track, there are 20 or 30 other guys waiting to eat your lunch and use you for traction. First lesson: Winning starts with the holeshot, and getting the holeshot is where Honda's CRF250R excels. We gave it an all-new DOHC engine last year, and this year we've continued with upgrades and refinements. Lesson number two: Hold on to the lead once you've got it. On a 250 this can be tough, especially in the slower corners. No problem on a 2019 CRF250R we've made specific improvements in power delivery to give you that critical edge in the tight stuff. The open-class guys can just point and shoot here, but on a 250 that's where a race is won and lost, by inches. So use every advantage you have, because you know what? There's going to be someone else on the starting line riding a 2019 CRF250R, and if you're not, you'll end up behind them.
Features may include:
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF250R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
The CRF250R is equipped with an effortless electric starter. Convenient and lightweight, it's a huge deal if you need to restart a stalled bike in the heat of battle.
NEW DOUBLE-SPRAY INJECTOR SETTINGS
The CRF250R's fuel-injection system sprays twice per intake cycle. That helps increase fuel atomization without adding the weight or complexity of a second injector. The better fuel atomization means more power in the midrange and on over rev you'll feel it the first time you race.
SHOWA SPRING FORK
The 49mm Showa fork features a conventional spring design that helps increase the CRF250R's front-suspension precision, handling and feel. The 39mm piston diameter and 25mm rod diameter guarantee a plush feel and supple action.

Comments for this 2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM:
Here now! Fun Fun!
2022 Suzuki DR-Z400SM
Suzuki's 2022 SuperMoto DR-Z400SM is based on the proven DR-Z400S. So it combines Supermotard style and features in a narrow, lightweight, street-legal package. This bike brings off-road soul and fun to paved roads. It's not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.
Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide, spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor. The inverted fork contributes to less unsprung weight and improved overall handling, while the large brake and wider rims with high-grip tires offer an exhilarating sportbike experience.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Lightweight, 398cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, dry-sump engine produces strong, tractable power.
Compact, four-valve cylinder head has 36mm intake valves, 29mm exhaust valves, narrow 28-degree included valve angle, and shim-under-bucket valve adjustment system.
Simple electric starting is powered via a lightweight starter motor with an automatic mechanical decompression system.
TRANSMISSION
Compact, five-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with a separate magnesium outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance.
Low-maintenance, long-life, sealed O-ring type drive chain produces minimal sounds when riding.
CHASSIS
Wide, black-anodized RK Excel aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes are fitted with sporty radial tires: 120/70-R17 front and 140/70-R17 rear.
Strong braking performance is supplied by a front disc brake with a large 300mm floating-type rotor and dual-piston caliper, plus a 240mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper.
Long travel, Showa inverted front fork is derived from the RM250 and features adjustable compression/rebound damping and a special coating on inner tube surfaces for smooth action.
ELECTRICAL
Compact, digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.
ADDITIONAL
12-month unlimited mileage limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP).*
A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for DR-Z400SM owners are available, including a low-profile seat, cargo rack, handguard set, and a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.

2019 Honda CRF450R
LAUNCH. HOLESHOT. PODIUM.
Heat after heat, race after race, Honda's CRF450R is hooking up riders like never before. If there's ever a machine that's given you an almost uncanny holeshot advantage, this is it. And for 2019, we've taken this awesome open-classer and made it even better. How? For starters, it's even lighter. Then there's an all-new chassis and swingarm, designed to work together for increased traction and cornering. The engine features longer head pipes for better throttle response and top-end pull. New fuel-injection settings spray twice per cycle to better atomize the fuel. And for the first time ever, there's a special launch-control setting, so it's easier than ever to grab the holeshot and hang on to your lead. What else is new? Plenty. The 2019 CRF450R better than ever.
Looking for the ultimate 450? Then check out our new CRF450R Works Edition. You get all the improvements of this year's bike plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID LT-X rims, exclusive Yoshimura mufflers, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and full-on HRC decals. The only thing missing is a factory contract!
Features may include:
NEXT-GENERATION ALUMINUM FRAME
The CRF450R's Next-Gen twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock's mounting point lower, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity for more holeshots. The frame geometry also helps improve traction, feeling and steering precision.
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF450R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
Kickstarting your bike is so 2016. By ditching the kickstarter entirely, our engineers can make the CRF450R lighter. Electric starters and lithium-ion batteries are so light now and so good that putting them on a bike like this is a win/win combination. And winning is what a CRF450R is all about.
ALL-NEW WORKS EDITION
Homologated for racing and available in limited numbers, the CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the improvements of this year's CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID LT-X rims, exclusive Yoshimura mufflers, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and an HRC decal package.

Sophisticated suspension technology provides the performance of a racing-style cartridge fork for reduced weight with linear damping characteristics.
High Performance Rear Mono Shock
Easily adjustable mono-shock rear suspension allows for dynamic cornering capability while preserving the hardtail look.

Description
Roadster™
The new Roadster™ motorcycle combines stoplight-to-stoplight power, agility and garage-built custom style to shatter every mold.
PURE ADRENALINE MEETS GARAGE-BUILT CUSTOM STYLE
1200 cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
An iconic V-Twin engine that is renowned for its massive low-end torque and soul-satisfying sound. Lightweight aluminum heads and cylinders improve air-cooling efficiency.
Blacked-Out Styling
There’s plenty of black to bring a dark edge to the garage-built look of the Roadster™ motorcycle. The mirrors, belt guard and headlamp are black. The oval air cleaner has a black insert. There are slotted black exhaust shields and a blacked-out powertrain.
Slammed Handlebars and New Gauge
You get the performance look and feel of slammed handlebars that put you in an aggressive riding position. And the gauge includes a speedometer and tach so you can keep track of what’s going on in your power plant.
43mm Front Suspension with Inverted Forks
The 43 mm front suspension with inverted forks features cartridge damping and the brawny look of massive new triple clamps. They’ll keep your rubber on the road when the pavement gets rough.
Dual Disc Front Brakes with Floating Rotors
Dual disc front brakes with floating rotors so you can be more confident in your stopping with all that muscle behind you.
Aggressive and Comfortable Two-Up Seat
The optimal combination of comfort and custom style. It’s a low profile, two-up seat with a nice, deep scoop to keep you firmly planted under acceleration, and it puts you just 29.5 inches off the ground for a low center of gravity and confident handling.
Light-Weight Offset Split 5-Spoke Wheels
19-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels that give the bike a custom look, easy-steering and a better power to weight ratio.

1981 Honda CX-500 Brat Bike,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcy/7579364622.html,7579364622,"$5,000","Up for sale is a 1981 Honda CX-500. This shaft drive classic will turn heads everywhere you go. If you don't know aobut the CX-500, the engine is mounted transverse, so the heads stick out the side of the bike a bit. This was Honda's first venture into the V-Twin engine. Makes for a torque-y bike! I have provided some images of what she looks like now and what she looked like when I started the project. There is a walkaround video down below with greater detail. She's come a long way!

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TFymxUWTCCSjuQWAshmO0znSq9gCvAk8/view?usp=drivesdk

The guy before me intentionally rusted the surface of the tank by sanding it down and letting the surface rust over. He sprayed some clear coat over the top and it's looked the way it does ever since. I ran with the his idea and now it looks like a rat rod style brat bike. >:) You could toss some clear coat on it if you wanted to keep the current look, or go balls to the wall and get the tank and frame painted. I just don't have any space to work on her at the moment, so she remains as she is.

She runs like a top and pulls strong through all the gears! With the Mikuni carbs on her, she's pretty spicy for a 500cc bike. Even the techs down at White's were digging it. I rode it around all summer on city streets and the freeway no problem. I have about $8K into the bike as she stands. Am happy to let you test ride with a pic of your license/endorsement + cash in hand. Looking to get $5K out of her OBO. This is not likely to be the bike you pick if you're on a budget or looking for a deal. I'm looking for a fellow enthusiast to whom I can pass the torch.

2023 KTM 300 XC
Maximum power at the least possible weight, amplified by low maintenance costs and smooth, linear power delivery - the 2023 KTM 300 XC is set to take the Open category back to school. Churning out massive power from an engine weighing only 52.6 lb, the KTM 300 XC sets the benchmark when it comes to power to weight ratios. Could the 2023 KTM 300 XC be the new Open Class president?
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
ENGINE
The new 300 cc 2-stroke powerhouse brings a new choice of weapon to the Open category and provides more choice for racers looking for maximum power at the least possible weight. Along with low maintenance costs and an overall engine weight of just 52.6 lb, the 2023 KTM 300 XC provides pure performance. Coupled together with advanced technical innovations, e-start, electronic fuel injection, and an electronic exhaust control, this is the new cross country kingpin.
CHASSIS
Frame
No matter how gnarly the trail is, you'll stay in complete control thanks to an all-new frame design that has not only been engineered for longitudinal rigidity, but also repositions rotating mass closer to the center of gravity. Thicker frame walls also improve reliability, flex characteristics and offer unmatched rider feel. A new shock mounting also provides improved anti-squat behavior for better traction out of corners, while the footpeg mounting position has moved inwards for less risk of hooking up on roots or rocks. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate.
POLYAMIDE-REINFORCED ALUMINIUM SUBFRAME
Weighing in at only 4 lb, the new 2-piece polyamide (60%) reinforced aluminum (40%) subframe provides impressive weight savings. With the help of computational dynamics, carefully calculated rigidity was engineered into the subframe, delivering outstanding handling and feedback, while remaining robust and reliable.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
48 mm air type WP XACT front fork with a split damping function provides all the confidence you need to attack the trails. New hydrostops in the fork legs improve bottoming-out resistance and account for less rebound when attacking big bumps while hauling across country. Redesigned fork protection rings also increase protection against dirt, making them as reliable as they are awesome.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
The 2023 KTM XC and XC-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high-grip orange seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. A handy grip pocket under the seat, just above the airbox, makes gripping the bike and lifting it much easier. In terms of graphics, the 2023 KTM XC and XC-F design takes its cue from the early 1990s when purple was one of KTM's predominant colors.
TECHNOLOGY
MAP SELECT SWITCH
The 2023 KTM 300 XC features a map select switch as standard, allowing the racer to switch between 2 perceptible engine maps. Map 1 provides a linear, predictable power delivery, while Map 2 gives it the full beans with crisp, explosive power output.
START/STOP SWITCH
Starting the 2023 KTM 300 XC is as easy as pressing a button. Literally! Lighting quick starts come thanks to an ultra-lightweight 12.8V 2 Ah lithium ion battery placed under the rider's seat, close to the center of gravity, new high-quality stator and pickup and super robust design, and an all-new start/stop button deisgn.

2023 Husqvarna TX 300 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new generation TX 300 engine is at the pinnacle of 2-stroke performance and weighs just 52.6 lb (23.9 kg). Complete with the latest technical innovations for 2023, the TX 300 receives significant updates with the new generation of Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) and electronic exhaust control reducing running costs and improving reliability. The new system works without a separate oil tank but with pre-mixed fuel identical to the motocross models. The result is a tailormade power delivery for each gear and every situation. The known E-Start adds to the simplicity of this popular model and guarantees fast starting in all conditions.
Ride easier
Frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023 to reposition rotational masses inside the engine which together with a new shock mounting position, significantly improves anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high-stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the standard skid plate.
Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
The bodywork clearly showcases Husqvarna Motorcycles' progressive approach to offroad motorcycles while the Swedish heritage-inspired blue and yellow graphics create a distinctive look. The ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
CNC-machined hubs and high-strength alloy rims by EXCEL are finished in striking black. They feature laser engraved logos and are fitted with a DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 tyre on the front and DUNLOP GEOMAX AT81 tyre on the rear which ensure progressive cornering and superior traction on a variety of terrain.
Technologically advanced
EFI
The introduction of Electronic Fuel Injection on the TX 300 brings many benefits. The ECU from Vitesco constantly analyses the running condition of the engine and delivers the perfect air/fuel ratio at all times through the state-of-the-art 39 mm Hitachi-Astemo (formerly Keihin) throttle body. The exciting addition of EFI allowed our engineers to develop two different engine maps, which can easily be selected via the handlebar-mounted switch for a personalised riding experience. Additionally, an important reed valve revision improves intake tract sealing and prevents excess fuel build up in the engine on extreme up or downhill sections for clean running at all times.

2023 KTM 350 XC-F Factory Edition
Inspired by the FMF KTM FACTORY RACING Team machines, the exclusive, limited edition KTM 350 XC-F FACTORY EDITION brings works-style weaponry to the cross-country battlezone. With its position at the peak of the KTM XC range, the FACTORY EDITON boasts pure READY TO RACE credentials, making it the choice of champions looking to not only win -- but to dominate at every level.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Perfectly filling the gap between the KTM 250 XC-F and the powerhouse KTM 450 XC-F, the lightweight KTM 350 XC-F FACTORY EDITION powerplant rules the roost in a class of its own. For 2023, the engine is tilted 2° backward with a lower sprocket position, which together with the benefits of mass centralization and reduced weight, makes the anti-squat behavior of the chassis second to none. With 450-rivalling performance and an overall engine weight of only 60.6 lb, you'll leave the competition with more than a little mud on the face.
CHASSIS
Frame
Just like the pros in the FACTORY TEAM, you'll stay in complete control thanks to an exclusive orange frame design that has not only been engineered for longitudinal rigidity, but also repositions rotating mass closer to the center of gravity. Thicker frame walls improve reliability and flex characteristics while offering unmatched rider feel. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the composite skid plate.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
48 mm air type WP XACT front fork with a split damping function provides all the confidence you need to attack the trails. New hydrostops in the fork legs improve bottoming-out resistance and account for less rebound when attacking big bumps while hauling across country. Redesigned fork protection rings also increase protection against dirt, making them as reliable as they are awesome.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
The 2023 KTM XC-F range features an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high-grip orange seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. A handy grip pocket under the seat, just above the airbox, makes gripping the bike and lifting it much easier. In terms of graphics, the 2023 KTM 350 XC-F FACTORY EDITION takes its cue from the FMF KTM FACTORY RACING Team.

2020 Yamaha MT-09
EYES OF DARKNESS
The industry benchmark in hyper naked agile handling, triple cylinder performance, and dark side inspired design.Features may include:
The Class-Defining Naked Sportbike
Packing aggressive style and impressive performance, Yamaha's original Hypernaked blew open the sportbike segment. Now wearing the MT-09 badge and more refined than ever, it features a potent inline-triple motor, adjustable traction control, a fully-adjustable fork, ABS, and an aggressive look unlike anything else on the road.
Powerful Inline-Triple
The MT-09's 847cc CP3 engine combines advanced electronic systems including YCC-T, Yamaha D-Mode and multi-mode traction control with a crossplane concept crankshaft to deliver an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character built around rider-centric control.
ENGINE
Advanced 3-Cylinder Engine
The MT-09 is powered by an 847cc liquid-cooled, inline 3-cylinder, DOHC engine with downdraft intake and ride-by-wire throttle control. With a 78.0mm x 59.1mm bore x stroke and 11.5:1 compression ratio, it produces an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character, perfectly splitting the best characteristics of both 2- and 4-cylinder motors in a compact, lightweight package.
Crossplane Concept CP3 Design
The MT-09's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept engine provides linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input, for responsive engine thrust with a strong feeling of power in the low- to mid-rpm range. To boost refinement and provide a smoother ride, the CP3 engine uses a compact counterbalancer to cancel out vibration.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Compact, Sporty Chassis
The MT-09 is built around a strong controlled-fill cast aluminum frame. The wheelbase, seat height, fuel tank width, rake and other dimensions are all set to work with the qualities of the compact 3-cylinder engine to achieve a sporty, light and neutral handling character, an upright riding position and a narrow feeling chassis at the seat/tank junction.
Fully Adjustable Inverted Fork
The 41mm inverted fork is fully adjustable for compression damping, rebound damping and spring preload. Not only does this allow riders greater flexibility in tuning their MT-09, the fork separates compression and rebound damping into separate fork legs, making it easier to fine-tune for the perfect setup across all 5.4 inches of fork travel.ADDITIONAL
Comfortable, Upright Ergonomics
Enjoy every ride thanks to upright ergonomics that balance front-end feedback with do-it-all practicality. The tapered aluminum handlebar, ideal placement of the seat and footpegs, and ultra-narrow frame and fuel tank create an excellent sense of feel between rider and machine. The long, flat seat improves rider comfort, and is roomier for a passenger, too.
LED Lighting
The MT-09 features LED headlights for brilliant illumination. The quad headlight unit produces a crisp spread of light for confidence in low-light conditions, and is matched to a 3D taillight design for head-turning style.ELECTRONICS
Advanced Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle
The ride-by-wire Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) system senses the slightest throttle input by the rider and instantaneously calculates the ideal throttle valve opening, and then actuates the throttle valves to actively control intake volume. This technology contributes to the rider's feeling of torque and controllability from the 3-cylinder engine.

Iron 883™
EVERYTHING YOU NEED, NOTHING YOU DON’T.
2020 Iron 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson® Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look.
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber. And black front forks with gators to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black-as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

2016 Harley Davidson SuperLow 1200T,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcd/d/grants-pass-2016-harley-davidson/7578769077.html,7578769077,"$8,495","When most motorcyclist talk about a touring bike, the exaggerated vision of “large” comes immediately to mind. Tall and heavy, intimidating and hard to maintain control over. Despite the general conceptions, there are exceptions to the rule and the Sportster SuperLow 1200T stands out, providing comfort, storage, style and a 26.1 inch seat height.

Harley “Baggers” normally weigh 800-900 pounds and more, 300-400 pounds more than the 1200T. With a low center of gravity and without the normal Harley “baggage”, the 1200T is easy to maneuver even at low speeds by most. It is not intimidating in it’s power delivery or it’s braking but does both well.

Harley took the 1200 Sportster and dressed it for Touring. They gave it mid-mounted foot controls, extra wide foot pegs and that 26.1 inch seat height. Lockable, Leather covered, weather resistant Saddle Bags are no wider than the handle bars so you do not have to worry about dragging them against anything you have already have passed. The Handle Bars have a nice reach to them without turning you into a parachute going down the road. There is a quick detach Windshield and a 4.5 Gallon Fuel tank that should be good for almost 200 miles at 48mpg. The transmission is a 5-Speed and the motor is Fuel Injected.

Our bike is cosmetically beautiful in its Vivid Black Paint with Silver Pin Stripping. Tires look to be at least 80% and the bike appears to need nothing but a new direction and fuel to go. If you want to ride and tour but not fight with a bike, this will be a great choice.

The selling price is $8,495, miles are 4,387. The VIN# is 1HD1LL318GC441738. For other interesting bikes and collectable vehicles, visit our web site http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 or come by and see us at 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97526. Oregon Dealer DA1287.

Without missing a beat, he asked if I was interested in buying a bike or just there to waste his time. Ted became an instant hero, clear to the point and aware that wasted time cannot be retrieved. The next thirty years saw me take delivery of three bikes from Ted and his son Joe who took over when Ted retired. The two of them represented, to me, transparency and integrity in retail by example. Hopefully Automania LLC will be seen in a similar light when the time arrives.

Forty-four years on, Joe has closed the dealership. Everything was sold except Joe’s own personal bikes. If there is a reward for owning a new Motorcycle Franchise, it must be housed in owning what ever model you desire, knowing what you want added with the ability and means to do so.

And so Joe did. He uncrated a 2012 Suzuki GSX-R750L, did the pre-delivery service and started adding parts!

This is the list of After Market and Factory parts Joe added to the motorcycle, all “dealer installed”. As a bonus of sorts, all of the stock parts were boxed and saved, now coming with the bike for it’s next owner.

LOW RIDER® S
Some meditate lying down, others lean into it
2020 LOW RIDER® S
Low Rider® S is an all-new blacked-out performance-cruiser with a style that’s as aggressive as its ride.
KEY FEATURES
Milwaukee-Eight 114 Engine
Loads of torque for blasting off from stoplights, hitting entrance ramps, and rolling on the passing power. Pure sound with a soul-satisfying rumble.
Reduced Rake
The Low Rider® S model frame rake is reduced to 28 degrees from the 30 degree rake of the standard Low Rider® model, resulting in more responsive handling.
Inverted Front Fork
Inverted design stiffens the front end for improved response to steering input, and the single-cartridge internal technology responds quickly to inputs and keeps the front wheel planted for improved braking and handling performance.
Softail® Frame
The frame retains the classic Softail® lines, but its lightweight design and stiffness translate to a responsive ride unlike anything you’ve felt before.
Mono-shock rear suspension
Easily adjustable mono-shock rear suspension allows for dynamic cornering capability, quicker acceleration, and braking while preserving the hardtail look.
Raw Dark Look
Blacked-out finishes, moto-style bars with 4-inch risers, and mini speed screen let everyone know that this machine wasn’t built for those who want to take the conventional route.
Raised Controls
The defining element of the tall-bike style. The 1-inch diameter motocross-style handlebar is mounted on 4-inch risers to put you in an aggressive riding position.
Cast-Aluminum Wheels
Radiate Cast-Aluminum Wheels are finished in a matte dark bronze to complete its raw dark look.
Dual Front Disc Brakes
Stronger braking performance with less lever effort than the single front disc brake on the standard Low Rider® model, and standard ABS (anti-lock braking system) for confident braking performance when conditions are less than ideal.

I need 2,000 cash and you take over payments.
I owe $13,000 to the Harley Davidson dealership in Silverdale. We can meet there with cash to test ride and take over payments. You must have cash and endorsement in hand for test ride.

Purchased used in 2021 with 400 miles. It has about 2k miles on it now. It had the first oil change / service and tune at 1k miles.

The paint is Billiard Blue with retro sunset graphics. I get compliments everywhere I go!

I had a Badlands seat, Willy G passenger pegs and HD sissy bar installed by HD so it’s ready for a passenger.

It has upgraded HD grips, Willy G foot pegs / clutch peg, knock off daylighter LED headlight and smoked LED turn signals, HD locking gas cap and color changing LED under lighting with remote.

It will come with the HD factory seat, pegs, grips, gas cap and headlight as well. I also ordered 2 spare factory keys and a manual for it.

This bike is in excellent shape and so much fun! I hate to see it go. I’m not interested in trades. I don’t need help selling it and I’m not desperate.

For extra money I can also add a HD half helmet with visor, Bell modular with Cardo and Shoei full face with Cardo. All size medium. Barely worn. Purchased in 2021 with 5 year warranty.

It is a great little scooter with a surprising amount of power, starts right up every time. You do not need an endorsement as it is only 49cc, only a standard drivers license. Does probably 35-40mph, and is VERY efficient on gas. Perfect little ‘around town transportation’, and super fun!

Orange in color, some of the paint is faded and it has little dings here and there I mean it’s 16 years old of course but all in all, I really think it’s a great deal. Where else are you going to get reliable transportation for $800 bucks!

Brand new battery, recent carb cleaning and tune up at Seattle Cycle Center, safety check and test drive to make sure everything is operational - came back with a clean bill of health.

2022 GASGAS MC 250F
$7,299.99*
Stock # 5255
Description
Our 'little' 4-stroke will put the biggest smile on your face. Welcoming and easy to ride yet capable of delivering impressive performance, the GASGAS MC 250F is the go-to bike for anyone that's serious about having fun in the dirt. Mixing a high-revving, fuel-injected, five-speed motor with playful and energetic handling it's a serious MX package for those who love the dirt.
Style Features
Bodywork: Red with a splash of white. That's the way we like it! The bodywork fitted to all GASGAS motocross bikes not only reflects our vibrant, Spanish personality but also ensures complete harmony between rider and bike. Considered ergonomics allow unrestricted movement while our flat, high-grip seat profile delivers comfort and control in all conditions.
Airbox: Less time working on bikes means more time riding bikes, which is exactly why you'll love the straightforward, no tools needed filter mounting system on all GASGAS motocross bikes. Allowing quick and easy filter changes, the airbox is designed with precisely positioned inlet ducts that ensure maximum airflow and protection of the Twin Air filter.
Handlebars, Grips & Throttle Assembly: Hold on, it's important! We fit all GASGAS motocross bikes with quality Neken tapered handlebars, guaranteeing comfort and control thanks to optimal pressure points on rider's hands. The left side ODI grip doesn't require gluing, while on the right, the vulcanized grip features an innovative integrated throttle mechanism. With easy to adjust free-play, by changing a cam, the progression of the throttle can also be altered.
Fuel Tank: We like to keep our fuel tanks simple and robust, that's why we opted for a threaded filler cap that provides a tight and reliable seal and positioned the external fuel line to make sure it's less exposed and susceptible to damage. The black 7-liter (1.85 gal) lightweight polythene fuel tanks feature direct internal line routing from the pump to the flange, for optimal fuel flow.
Handling Features
Subframe: With a short and compact profile all GASGAS motocross subframes are made from lightweight aluminum. The profile helps centralize mass while also keeping weight down.
Frame: The technology in our frames ensures riders enjoy playful handling and an energetic feeling on any motocross tracks. Underneath the red powder coating there's a lightweight chromium molybdenum steel, hydro-formed, laser-cut and robot-welded chassis that's built to perform. Designed to be rigid where it needs to be rigid and to flex where flex is needed, it provides exceptional rider feedback, energy absorption and straight-line stability.
Forged Triple Clamps: Featuring a 4-way handlebar adjustment that allows riders to set-up the front-end of their bikes just the way they like it, the forged, 22mm offset triple clamps work in harmony with our WP front forks to help deliver precise handling and stability.
Front Suspension: All GASGAS motocross models are equipped with advanced, super-lightweight 48mm WP XACT upside-down forks that are easily adjustable. Delivering progressive and consistent damping no matter how rough the track, they feature a capsulated air spring and pressurized oil chamber together with other internal damping wizardry. The end result is outstanding rider comfort and front-end confidence.
Rear Suspension: Traction is what it's all about and our fully adjustable WP XACT rear shock provides the advanced damping that inspires confidence and ignites fun. Designed to work harmoniously with both frame and swingarm to offer incredible energy absorption, the shock is also matched to a linkage system with a specific geometry that further aids traction. Rebound and high/low speed compression adjustment and 300mm of travel means GASGAS motocross bikes are ready to take on the roughest tracks.
Swingarm: Light, strong and featuring visible chain adjustment marks to make life at the track easier, our motocross swingarms are made using a gravity die-cast process to guarantee durability and precision
Motor Features
Motor: The performance our compact 250cc motor kicks out is nothing short of incredible. That's all thanks to clever manufacturing that allows thrilling power to be squeezed from the 25.9kg (57 lbs) power unit when revved at 14,000 rpm. As well as its awesome power, the compact design also improves the overall handling of the bike
Cylinder Head And Balancer Shaft: The MC 250F loves to be revved, which is all possible thanks to the DOHC cylinder head that features large titanium valves and finger followers with a tough Diamond Like Carbon (DLC). The result is minimal friction and optimal performance. The carefully designed combustion chamber produces efficient, high-level power across the entire rev range with the motor also fitted with a multifunctional balancer shaft, which drives the coolant pump and the timing chain.
Cylinder & Piston: Performing an important role in delivering the lively performance that makes the MC 250F so much fun to ride, both the cylinder and piston are professionally engineered from high strength aluminum. Guaranteeing outstanding performance and reliability the 78mm bore houses a rigid, forged bridged-box-type piston made by CP.
Transmission: The right gear, every time. With a low-friction coating on the internal shifting fork, all 5 gear changes on the MC 250F are smooth and purposeful. Light and durable, and featuring motocross specific ratios, the 5-speed transmission itself ensures all power is transferred to the rear wheel, exactly when it's needed.
Crankshaft: Up and down, round and round... life's tough being a 250F crankshaft. Good job that the spinning heart of the MC 250F motor is designed to offer durability and the best possible performance. Carefully located within the motor it also helps centralize oscillating masses for super easy handling.
Crankcase: The protective housing that keeps all internal components safe and secure! Holding all internal parts in the perfect positions to achieve the ideal center of gravity, the high-pressure casting process ensures strength and thin wall thickness for minimal weight.
Exhaust System: Our exhaust systems are key to the power delivery of all GASGAS motocross bikes. Developed to be slim using an innovative 3D process, they comply with FIM sound regulations, look great and most importantly deliver the very best performance.The MC 250F features two-part exhaust systems that are expertly designed to deliver awesome performance at the lowest possible weight. They can also be removed without needing to take out the rear shock! Further innovation allows for a short, compact silencer that keeps sound levels down and looks up.
Dds Clutch: The MC 250F features a Damped Diaphragm Steel (DDS) clutch, which is robust, super reliable and contributes to the compact design of the engine. Featuring a single diaphragm steel pressure plate instead of traditional coil springs, it also has a clutch basket CNC machined from a single piece of steel for incredible durability.
Parts Features
Brakes: Fast is fun but slowing down is essential, which is why all GASGAS motocross bikes are fitted with Brembo calipers and controls. With 260mm front and 220mm rear disks, braking is easy, inspiring riders to push harder and ride faster.
Brembo Hydraulic Clutch: No need for adjustment and a near maintenance-free operation, but the best thing about the Brembo hydraulic clutch is that it delivers a perfectly smooth action time and time again. With lever free-play automatically adjusted, the biting point and function of the clutch remain constant no matter if it's hot or cold.
Integrated Cooling System And Radiators: Keeping our bikes slim means better handling, which is why the GASGAS motocross range features cooling systems that are integrated into the frames. Also allowing for improved cooling due to eliminating the need for additional hoses, together with the high-strength, lightweight radiators the complete system ensures, well, our bike stay super cool no matter how tough the conditions!
Tyres: Connecting rider and bike to the track the Maxxis MaxxCross MX-ST tires are designed to be durable, grippy and deliver the performance that completes our proven performance bikes. Inspiring confidence and boosting predictability the tread pattern is designed to maximize traction and braking performance.
Wheels: Built to take a beating, our wheels are ready to play rough. No matter how heavy the landing or how rough the track, the silver, high-strength rims, CNC machined hubs and lightweight spokes deliver maximum strength for complete peace of mind.
Electronics Features
Engine Management System - Ems: Super small but the best there is when it comes to processing engine data. Used to control all parameters linked to the fuel-injections system, the Keihin EMS unit also features a gear sensor that allows a tailored power delivery for each gear.
44 Mm Throttle Body: The MC 250F uses a 44mm Keihin throttle body with an injector positioned to ensure the most efficient flow of fuel mixture into the combustion chamber. But what's most important to all riders is the fact that the direct cable mounting system ensures an immediate throttle response.
Electric Start And Li-Ion Battery: No need to kick, kick, kick! All GASGAS 4-strokes motocross bikes are fitted with an electric starter as standard. Saving time at the start of a day when a motor's cold, or near the end of a race when the motor's hot, with the simple press of a button the MC 250F fires into life. Using a lightweight Li-Ion 2.0 Ah battery together with a robust starter motor from Mitsuba and a reliable starter drive guarantees reliable starting. Always.

2022 Honda Rebel 300 ABS
RIDE TO YOUR OWN DRUM
If you're looking to stand out on the street and ride with total comfort and confidence, you need to check out the 2022 Rebel 300. It's a canvas for self-expression that will lead you to endless rides of self-discovery. The Rebel combines timeless cruiser style with a low seat height, user-friendly powerband, and the latest technology, like an LED lighting package and optional ABS. The narrow 286cc single cylinder and Honda slipper/assist clutch deliver inspired performance on straightaways and twisties alike. And when it comes to personalization, we've got you covered, with a full line of available Honda accessories.
Features may include:
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one's not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone's lineup. It's comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
This technology was first developed and perfected in Honda's racing machines. The slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It's technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Hondas are famous for their engines, and we've given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it's a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it's a single, it's light and super narrow, which helps reduce the overall bike's weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that's well suited for all levels of riders.

PRESS:
For all practical purposes, 1980 was still the '70s in the world of motor­cycles. Handlebars were still gener­ally high, footpegs were out front, and sportbikes were, for the most part, hot-rodded standards. The hottest of these was Kawasaki's KZ550, a handsome-enough sunset-striped middleweight UJM that combined reasonable weight with decent power to rule the box-stock class at local racetracks. In fact, when Kawasaki noticed that its dealers couldn't keep the KZ in stock and that racers were buying them used for new-bike prices, it put together a bike that wound up changing the entire motorcycling landscape. The GPz550 is arguably one of the most influential motorcycles in history, and its four-year run absolutely launched the sportbike as we know it.
The magic of the bike was simple: Kawasaki simply took what racers were doing to the KZ and put it into production. The 1981 GPz550 got the KZ's oversquare two-valve 553cc engine, but with higher compression, hotter cams, electronic ignition, and an oil cooler. The rest of the bike got a second front disc, a disc instead of a drum out back, an air fork, adjustable damping on the shocks, lower handlebars, and rearset pegs. A little cafe fairing was fitted to the headlight, the engine and exhaust were blacked out, and Kawasaki sent it out into the world.

2022 Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT
Be ready for adventure with help from the new generation 2022 V-STROM 1050XT. Adding to the V-STROM legend, the 1050XT is poised to help you escape everyday concerns and explore to your heart's content. The V-STROM's sleek, distinctive look with effective mechanical and electronic features delivers a smooth, comfortable, and worry-free ride. Limitless potential is engineered in so you can continue your adventure without pause.
Distinctive styling incorporates elements from Suzuki's legendary DR-Z Dakar racer and the large DualSport DR-Big. The characteristic beak design first adopted by Suzuki stays true to its heritage while being more aggressive and bolder at the nose of the V-STROM 1050XT.
The V-STROM's 1037cc, 90-degree V-twin engine produces more peak power than ever before while maintaining its strong pull off the bottom and superb fuel economy while complying with emissions standards worldwide. High-lift camshafts and big-bore pistons are fed by a pair of large, 49mm Ride-by-Wire electronic throttle bodies that deliver smooth, light throttle action and precise speed control while using the standard cruise control system.
Features may include:
Engine
The liquid-cooled, DOHC, 1037cc, 90-degree V-twin engine delivers more horsepower than the prior generation powerplant with the same level of torque and fuel economy while achieving worldwide emissions compliance.
The large-bore, high-compression pistons were engineered with the use of FEM analysis to achieve ideal rigidity, weight, and improved durability.
Both the exhaust and intake camshafts have increased valve lift timing with less overlap to boost engine power while reducing fuel consumption.
Advanced
Integrated into the 2022 V-STROM 1050XT is the Suzuki Intelligent Ride System (S.I.R.S.) that includes the Motion Track Anti-lock** and Combination Brake System with rider-selectable ABS sensitivity, Hill Hold Control System, Slope Dependent Control System, and Load Dependent Control System that assists braking performance in a variety of conditions.
Key to the operation of S.I.R.S., the V-STROM 1050XT employs an interconnected information network instead of a conventional wiring harness.
Chassis
The 2022 V-STROM 1050XT's trim, distinctive styling incorporates elements of both Suzuki's legendary DR-Z Dakar racer and the large DualSport DR-Big. Since its introduction by Suzuki, the characteristic off-road beak design has become an integral feature of a modern Adventure-style motorcycle. The V-STROM's beak is augmented with a vertically stacked LED headlight with a unique rectangular shape. The headlight effectively illuminates the road surfaces and surrounding areas, so the rider has an excellent view of what's ahead.
A mounting bar just below the rider's eye level is part of the windscreen mount, providing a good place to position accessories like a GPS for navigation.

2022 Suzuki Boulevard C50
Be ready to be the center of attention as the 2022 Suzuki Boulevard C50 will turn heads wherever you ride. The Boulevard C50 stamps a bold impression on traditional cruiser styling that includes a kicked-out fork, valance-style fenders, and a staggered, chromed, dual exhaust system. Its fuel-injected, 50 cubic inch, V-twin engine delivers abundant torque and is engineered for comfort. On city streets or the open highway, its spacious riding position and smooth suspension let you cruise comfortably all day long, while its rear suspension delivers the appearance of a classic hardtail.
Features may include:
Candy Daring Red or Solid Iron Gray paint with understated tank graphics augment the Boulevard's classic posture.
With a light pull, the clutch feeds engine power to the smooth-shifting five-speed transmission and out to the clean shaft drive.
The classically styled 4.1-gallon fuel tank complements the large, valance fenders that hover over the wide 15-inch rear and 16-inch front tires mounted on spoke-style chrome wheels.
Beefy tires on wide, spoke-style chrome wheels bring a nostalgic look while delivering modern performance.
Engine
Narrow, 805cc, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, SOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder, 45-degree, V-twin engine is tuned for exceptional low rpm torque.
Offset crankpins bring optimally balanced firing intervals and create a signature V-twin rumble.
Auto Fast Idle System (AFIS) automatically sets the throttle-valve opening during cold engine starts by monitoring coolant temperature.
Chromed and staggered dual exhaust system mounted on the right side of the engine is tuned for responsive torque delivery, providing a deep, rumbling exhaust note.
Chassis
Strong, double-cradle steel frame supports a chassis ready for cruising or a full-on tour.
Link-type rear suspension is shaped to mimic the hard-tail lines of a traditional cruiser, connecting a truss-style swingarm and a single shock absorber with seven-way spring preload adjustability, providing 4.1 inches of smooth and responsive suspension travel.
Stout telescopic front forks deliver generous 5.5 inches of smooth wheel travel.
A wide 15-inch rear tire and matching 16-inch front tire are mounted to bright, spoke-style wheels for a classic cruiser look.

Anyone up for some CBR action??? Well here ya go!! This is a darn clean 600RR with low miles and is ready to hit 15000rpms all day! This bike also has a FULL YOSHIMURA EXHAUST SYSTEM, fender eliminator kit and is ready to rip! Come in and check it out for yourself. We have financing inside of our beautiful store and a lot of bikes to pick and chose from. COME ON DOWN!
2018 Honda CBR600RR
Engineered For Laps And Canyons.
The 2018 CBR600RR is designed with the superb balance to tear up the track and make scenic canyons truly breathtaking. So it's an ideal bike to use as a weekday commuter, a weekend joy ride machine and, of course, for cutting laps on the aforementioned track.
Bred from MotoGP engineering, this bike is a true reflection of Honda's technical prowess. It's light, compact, nimble and ideally-balanced, with a four-cylinder engine that revs like nothing you've ever ridden. The aluminum twin-spar designed chassis delivers laser-sharp handling. And when it comes to braking, it's your choice of either a conventional triple-disc setup or a specialized version of Honda's revolutionary Combined Anti-Lock Braking System (C-ABS), an industry first on a production Supersport motorcycle.
Track or street, with the 2018 CBR600RR it's a win-win situation.
Features may include:
Winning Heritage
With well over 700 total MotoGP victories, Honda's winning heritage stands far above any other manufacturer, just as Honda's motorcycles stand out on the street. Our superior engineering and technology put our GP bikes in the winners' circle and give you the performance you need for the street.
Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD)
One of the keys to the CBR600RR's extraordinary handling is the compact HESD. It helps maintain predictable high-speed handling and low-speed maneuverability so you can focus on riding.
Amazing Stopping Power
The CBR600RR's Combined Anti-Lock Braking System (C-ABS) is the first of its kind on a Supersport machine, and it's had the critics raving.

2023 Kawasaki KX250X
GET THE OFF-ROAD EDGE
The championship-proven technology of KX race machines has now been tuned for off-road competition. Purposely designed to take on tough off-road conditions, the KX250X motorcycle delivers the edge to ride ahead. No matter how technical the terrain, lead with confidence on the KX250X.
Features may include:
KX POWER
EXPERIENCE LEGENDARY POWER
The KX250X motorcycle features the same updated podium-ready engine of the legendary KX250 motocross bike. This fuel-injected 249cc 4-stroke engine delivers high-revving performance to power past the competition. Engine maps are optimized for cross-country racing, delivering the ideal amount of useable power. Electric start makes starting the engine as easy as a push of a button. A coned disc-spring hydraulic clutch offers a direct feel, light lever action, and consistent performance.
KX PERFORMANCE
COMPETE WITH CONFIDENCE
Light and nimble handling comes by way of a lean, lightweight chassis, the same one featured on the KX250 motocross bike. Overall weight is kept low thanks to a well-balanced aluminum perimeter frame, which also allows for slim ergonomics. The high-performance, race-ready suspension has been optimized for cross-country racing, especially on aggressive trails. Large-diameter disc brakes deliver strong stopping power, offering a high level of control.
CROSS-COUNTRY CAPABILITY
TAKE ON TOUGH TRAILS
The KX250X motorcycle is built to meet the tough demands of cross-country racing. Cross-country wheels (F21 /R18 ) are paired with soft-to-intermediate terrain Dunlop Geomax AT81 tires. A factory-style skid plate and a convenient side stand both come as standard equipment.
ERGO-FIT ERGONOMICS
GET THE PERFECT FIT
Slim ergonomics stem from a narrow frame and minimalist bodywork. To help facilitate the perfect fit, the KX250X motorcycle features new wider and repositioned footpegs and ERGO-FIT adjustability. Four handlebar positions and two footpeg positions allow you to tailor the KX250X to your body size, riding style and preference.

Simply one of the best adventure/commuter style bikes made to this day! This bike features ALL Hondaline hard bags and top box. It also is equipped Bark Buster handguards, GIVI crash guards, and a V-stream windshield. Folks, these bikes are extremely hard to find new or used so don't wait around, this bike will not not be here for long! TEST RIDES WELCOME!
2017 Honda NC700X
Way Ahead of the Curve.
On weekdays the NC700X is an awesome commuter. On weekends it's a completely different animal. An explorer in the country and a devoted carver on twisty canyon roads. All made possible by the NC700X's 670cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin engine offering a generous helping of useable torque, and the seating position for whatever adventure you have in mind.
The bike offers more than endless possibilities. It offers practically endless features. It sports a large windscreen for better weather protection, tough-looking bodywork, and a pentagonal muffler for a tighter look and a sound you're bound to love. The luggage compartment holds a full 22 liters, and comes with a utility rail and a storage hook inside the lid. Available in two versions the conventional six-speed, manual-clutch transmission remains one choice, while a second version is available with Honda's exclusive automatic Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Even the tires are easy to service, thanks to L-shaped valve stems. All of these features add up to the most versatile option around, the NC700X.
Features may include:
670cc of Liquid-Cooled Possibilities.
The NC700X's 670cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin engine produces enough torque and enough power to guzzle up adventure. But it can sip, too the standard transmission version has an estimated fuel economy of 64 MPG**. **Honda's fuel economy estimates are based on EPA exhaust emission measurement test procedures and are intended for comparison purposes only. Your actual mileage will vary depending on how you ride, how you maintain your vehicle, weather, road conditions, tire pressure, installation of accessories, cargo, rider and passenger weight, and other factors.
Take in the View.
The NC700X has a large windscreen that makes the cockpit comfortable over a wide range of speeds. And in the upright seating position you have a great view in traffic, making this bike even more appealing.
Integrated Storage Compartment
The NC700X offers an integrated storage compartment holding a full 22 liters. It features a storage hook and a utility rail, because we all ride with more than just a cell phone and a credit card.
Automatic Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)
Honda's revolutionary Automatic DCT transmission is changing the way people ride. It's smooth, smart and the clear choice for a machine like this. Want to shift it yourself? The handlebar-mounted paddle-style buttons put you in control. It's the best of both worlds.

2022 CFMoto Papio
MINI TO THE MAX
The stylish Papio is a special breed of motorcycle designed for, well, everyone. And it's affordable, so you can easily spring for a his and hers. The single-cylinder, air-cooled engine needs only 126cc to whisk you into a whole new world of fun. On top of that, it's practical and easy to maintain. Just put in a little gas and ride. This little beauty turns your basic, garden-variety errand into a great escape. People will stare. Many will smile. Some will even wave. The rest will wonder why they don't have a couple of Papios in their garage.
Features may include:
The Papio features the only air-cooled engine in the lineup. At 126cc, it is lightweight, simple, and extremely reliable. Paired with a 6-speed transmission, the fun kicks off with the simple flick of the wrist. Premium components include a telescopic front suspension with 109mm of travel. The rear monoshock gives you 5-click preload adjustability. When the subject is stopping, the Papio has plenty going for it. Braking is effortless. Up front, the two-piston floating caliper grabs hold of a 210mm disc. In the rear, a single-piston floating caliper pairs up nicely with a 190mm disc.
Loaded with Extras
A digital LCD display and LED lights add to the list of features that make the Papio one of the best-equipped and lowest-priced mini bikes on the market.
Great Riding Stability
Benefitted from large disc brakes (210mm) and a top-tier suspension system, the bike's front, and rear shock absorbers react sensitively to road conditions.
Advanced Safety
Compared to older models, the Papio's newly developed tires add width, which provides advanced grip and driving stability for ultimate safety and fun.
New Generation Single-Cylinder Air-Cooled Engine
With a completely upgraded 126cc engine and fine-tuned Bosch EFI system, the new Papio boasts maximum torque at lower engine rpm. This lightweight air-cooled single-cylinder engine wins the most efficient in-town commuter award with its quick, simple, and reliable design.
Euro Styling
It's your city runabout. It's your daily commuter. And with its modern Euro design, you're sure to arrive in style wherever you go.
Disc Brakes
Disc brakes bring the Papio to a rapid, controlled stop. Chalk it up to the large front rotor sporting a two-piston floating caliper and the rear disc with its single piston floating caliper.
Suspension
Small means fun, nimble, and easy to ride. A well-designed frame and great suspension help. Check out the telescopic front fork with 109mm of travel and the 5-click preload adjustable monoshock.
6-Speed Transmission
Power is fed to the rear wheel via a fun-to-shift six-speed tranny. It's ideal for the city commuter who wants to zip around without any fuss.

2023 Husqvarna TC 250
The next evolution in motocross technology
The addition of the latest technical innovations ensures the 2023 TC 250 remains on the top step in the competitive 250cc 2-stroke motocross class. Now featuring E-Start and Electronic Fuel Injection, starting is simplified while performance on track remains unrivalled thanks to the highly sophisticated EFI system that delivers the perfect air/fuel ratio for an instant, controllable power at all times. Expertly assembled with premium components as standard, the TC 250 benefits from exceptional build quality, which guarantees both performance and reliability. On top, new graphics inspired by the brand's Swedish heritage create a striking new look, which is applied to all-new bodywork that provides advanced ergonomics.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new TC 250 engine is at the pinnacle of 2-stroke performance and weighs just 23.9 kg. Complete with the latest technical innovations for 2023, the TC 250 receives significant updates with Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) reducing running costs, removing the need for jetting changes, and improving reliability. The addition of E-Start adds to the simplicity of this popular model and guarantees fast starting in all conditions.
Cylinder
The new cylinder retains a 66.4 mm bore and with the introduction of EFI for 2023, the traditional powervalve is replaced with an electronic exhaust control system. This highly innovative technology manages the opening of the lateral exhaust ports before the main exhaust ports open to deliver strong, controllable power. The upper contour of the exhaust port features a machined finish for improved port timing and unrivalled performance.
Crankshaft
The crankshaft is designed with weight reduction in mind to increase the liveliness and throttle response from the engine. The perfect balance of rotating masses is achieved by balancing the weights of the crankshaft flywheel, the new rotor, and the counter balancer shaft.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 1.8 kg. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
Triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A new, flatter seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.

Comments for this 2019 Zero FXS ZF7 2:
Electric Motorcycle FXS ZERO Super Clean! Very well taken care of. Cool rare bike!!! Extra set of new tires! Plenty of miles remaining on current tires. LED conversions on blinkers and headlight. Fold in mirrors. Handguards.
2019 Zero FXS ZF7.2
STEALTHY SUPERMOTO
Quick. Mean. Compact. With precise handling and blistering acceleration, the Zero FXS stealthily shreds any urban slalom or conquers your local track with tarmac carving fierceness. Combining off road ruggedness with on-road agility, the Zero FXS is the ultimate way to cut through the concrete jungle.
POWERFUL. MINIMALIST.
The Zero FXS delivers unfiltered thrill by combining our most compact Z-Force powertrain with Pirelli Diablo Rosso II tires and the off-road DNA of the Zero FX. No shifting or clunkiness. Directly connect your desire for speed with instant, massive, silent, and seamless acceleration.
CHARGING. NO STATION NEEDED.
Standard outlet. Done. No special charging equipment required. Your household outlets just became fueling stations that deliver daily rides at a fraction of the cost of gasoline. Ride up to 100 miles a day in the city and plug in overnight to start the next day with a full tank.
Instant full tank
Ride. Swap batteries. Continue. The Zero FXS's optional hot-swappable tech allows you to go from empty to full in seconds. Depleted additional batteries can be easily charged while you ride using off-board charging accessories.
PASS ON SERVICE.
Imagine savage performance delivered without tedious and greasy servicing regimes. Forget oil changes, spark plugs, clutches, filters, chain adjustments or expensive tune-ups. Instead, a carbon fiber belt cleanly connects the rear wheel to an air-cooled Z-Force motor that uses a single moving part. Swap threadbare tires. Replace used-up brake pads. Ride.
Always advancing. Code for the Z-Force powertrain is constantly refined to deliver improved performance. The Zero App easily delivers the upgrades using your mobile device.
GO THE DISTANCE.
The Zero FXS travels up to 100 mi when traversing city streets. At its core is Zero's most compact and lightweight Z-Force battery that, like rest of the lineup, boasts the highest power and energy density in the EV industry.
Don't need the range and looking for Zero's most economical model? Drop some weight. The Zero FXS ZF3.6 cuts the battery's weight and size by roughly fifty percent. Add a second battery module at any time to match the range and performance of the ZF7.2.
Features may include:
Battery
The Zero FXS is available in two battery configurations. The ZF3.6 features modular battery technology that allows riders to add a second battery to double range and makes it possible to fully recharge by quickly swapping batteries on the fly. The ZF7.2 is fully integrated into the motorcycle and is the more economical option for those looking to maximize the range of the Zero FXS.
Motor
The Zero FXS powerplant produces up to 78 ft-lb of torque. The air-cooled Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motor delivers impressive performance and fierce acceleration, which works in conjunction with regenerative braking to channel energy back into the battery.
Nose
Twin projector beam headlamps flood the road ahead with light, and an integrated fly screen adds an aggressive styling touch.
Dash
Minimalist. Cool blue LCD. The Zero FXS dash projects the specs you need: speed, state of charge, power output, selected riding profile, projected recharge time. Sync with your smartphone to turn it into a secondary customizable dash or view detailed ride stats.
Suspension
The Zero FXS's Showa suspension offers outstanding articulation and full adjustability. With nearly 9 inches of rear travel, the Zero FXS offers superior damping to smooth out the road's imperfections.

These 800's have a superrrrr smooth transmission, gobs of torque and amazing suspension for any terrain you can throw at it. Come take it for a spin and see what we mean!
2016 Triumph Tiger 800 XRT
The Tiger 800 XRT provides the highest levels of comfort and technology for the perfect adventure. The combination of switchable ABS, traction control, and rider modes provide full reassurance and the additional of luxury features such as heated rider and passenger seats, heated grips, and a larger 650W alternator that can power other auxiliary items meaning that all year riding is always on the agenda. Visibility is enhanced with the LED fog lamps, and the touring capabilities are maximised with the standard fitment of pannier rails that are ready to take the optional Expedition luggage set.
At the heart of the XRT is an 800cc triple engine with 95PS and incredible levels of torque for a linear power delivery no matter what gear you are in. With power on demand and a chassis tuned for dynamic handling, the XRT makes every journey an experience.
Overview
Delivering a seamless flow of torque across the rev range, the Tiger 800 is as perfectly suited to long distance rides as it is to tackling the tough stuff. The second generation 800cc engine features a ride-by-wire throttle system which provides smoother power delivery, better response, and lower emissions. The result is a 17% improvement in fuel efficiency that coupled with the capacious 19l fuel tank means you can ride longer
differentTrip Computer
The LCD screen displays time, ambient temperature, fuel gauge, gear indicator, odometer and journey distance.
The Tiger 800 XRX and XCX models add more functionality with extended information including: journey time, average speed, average fuel consumption, range to empty and instantaneous fuel consumption.
Electronic Riding Modes
Switch from road to off-road to rider programmable modes on the fly - and overcome the weather, the road and whatever nature can throw at you.
The Tiger 800 range offers three different Riding Modes that allow the adjustment of the throttle maps, ABS and TTC to suit different road conditions. Select either ROAD or OFF-ROAD mode and the throttle maps, ABS, and Triumph Traction Control are automatically set.
RIDER MODE allows you to configure these settings independently to suit your own personal riding style. In RIDER MODE, the throttle maps can be switched between RAIN, ROAD, SPORT, and OFF-ROAD settings.
Traction Control
Every Tiger 800 features first-in-class standard fitment of Triumph Traction Control (TTC) that prevents the unexpected spinning of the rear wheel and cuts the engine torque to avoid the loss of lateral grip.
The XCX/XCA and XRX/XRT feature advanced Traction Control with three settings:
1. ROAD: optimised for road use, allowing minimal rear wheel slip
2. OFF ROAD: allows increased rear wheel slip
3. OFF: disables the traction control setting

2020 Suzuki V-Strom 1050 XT ABS (100079) Excellent Condition, Low Miles @ 5226, Equipped with Top Case. ""PRICED RIGHT"" @......$14535!

2020 Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT
Introducing the new generation 2020 V-STROM 1050XT. The latest entry into the V-STROM legend is here to help you escape into the wilderness and explore to your heart’s content. A sleek look with the latest features allows for a smooth and comfortable ride. Limitless potential is engineered in so you can continue your adventure without pause.
Distinctive styling incorporates elements of both Suzuki’s legendary DR-Z Dakar racer and the large DualSport DR-Big. The characteristic beak design first adopted by Suzuki stays true to its heritage while being more aggressive and bolder for the new generation V-STROM.
The V-STROM’s 1037cc, 90-degree V-twin engine has more peak power than ever before while maintaining its strong pull off the bottom and superb fuel economy while complying with emissions standards worldwide. New camshafts and pistons are fed by a pair of large, 49mm, Ride-by-Wire electronic throttle bodies that deliver smooth, light throttle grip action while allowing the addition of a precise cruise control system.
Features may include:
Where the horizon ends, the adventure begins. Whether it’s a long-distance quest or a short-distance journey, the V-Strom is the versatile machine designed for the spirit of discovery.
ENGINE
The updated, liquid-cooled, DOHC, 1037cc, 90-degree V-twin engine delivers more horsepower with the same level of torque and fuel economy while achieving worldwide emissions requirements.
The perfect primary balance provided by the 90-degree L-twin design negates the need for any balancer shafts or rubber mounting, as the engine has smooth power pulses.
The new, higher compression pistons were engineered with the use of FEM analysis to achieve ideal rigidity, weight, and improved durability.
CHASSIS
Movement of the cast aluminum swingarm is controlled by a single rear shock with remote, hydraulic spring preload adjustment so adjusting for cargo or a passenger takes just seconds. The single-shock, link-style rear suspension also features rebound-damping force adjustment.
Tokico Monoblock, four-piston front brake calipers are mated with 310mm floating-mount dual discs. These efficient calipers are connected to the Motion Track Anti-lock** and Combination Brake System for strong stopping performance.
Bridgestone Battlax Adventure A41 tires are fitted to D.I.D-supplied spoke-style wheels with aluminum, tubeless-style wheel rims.
ELECTRICAL
The V-STROM 1050XT has new, lightweight and low-draw LED turn signals that are brighter than the signals used on the prior V-Strom models.
The V-STROM 1050XT features an all-new, multifunction instrument panel that presents all required information on a full Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen using a clean and intuitive layout with information displayed in order of priority.
ADDITIONAL
A wide variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for V-STROM 1050XT owners are available, including luggage, heated grips, high- and low-profile seats, auxiliary lights, and a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.

Description
STREET BOB®
Straight-up, two-fists-in-the-wind attitude and no extra fat are the ingredients that went into the all-new, blacked-out Street Bob® motorcycle.
DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF ANYONE TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
Stripped-Down, Raw Bobber Style
Features mini-ape handlebars, laced wheels, and dark finishes.
All-New Softail Frame
A lighter, stiffer frame (compared to previous Softail and Dyna models) that takes the idea of form and function to a place it’s never been before. It’s the look of a hardtail from a bygone era that delivers a thoroughly modern ride.
Milwaukee-Eight 107 Engine
A powerful, smooth-running Big Twin engine with crisp throttle response and a pure, soul-satisfying rumble.
Minimalist, Modern Technology
You get digital instrumentation, keyless ignition, a USB charging port, and Signature LED forward lighting.
High Performance Front Suspension
New suspension technology provides the performance of a racing-style cartridge fork for reduced weight with linear damping characteristics.
High Performance Rear Mono Shock
All-new easily adjustable mono-shock rear suspension allows for dynamic cornering capability while preserving the hardtail look.

Cons:
I bought the bike from a guy who bought it from an Auction in Idaho.
There is much more to the story and I can show all paperwork back tracing how I acquired it and what I've done to it.
The bike technically has 2200 miles on it (but more on that later)
Chip off the right side upper plastic fairing.
Missing the center fairings on the top of the gas tank.

Bike starts every time.
I'm negotiable on price. cash talks.",salvage,gas,5800,manual,dual,white,salvage,800,,yes,,,,

2022 CFMoto 650 Adventura
LET FREEDOM REV
It’s long been said there are two kinds of people—leaders and followers. But in fact, we were all born to lead our own lives. If you’re ready to embrace this truth, this is the motorcycle you are meant to ride. The 650 Adventura reveals a whole new world of riding opportunity. Call it a dual sport. Call it a touring bike. Call it your ticket to freedom. This one does it all. Concrete slap to graded gravel road, you’re fully equipped to kick dust in the face of a world that tries so hard to constrain you.
Features may include:
You can waste the prime of your riding life saving for a bigger, more powerful adventure bike. But why would you? The Adventura is purpose-built for every purpose. The experience starts with the pulse-quickening, 640cc parallel twin featuring Bosch EFI—the source of instant throttle response. The 6-speed transmission is buttery smooth. And since you’ll be venturing far and wide, there’s plenty of ground clearance and suspension travel to keep you in full control—through the curves, down the straights, and across the narrow.
Protection from the Elements
Riding through raw weather is part of the adventure. And the adjustable windscreen offers great coverage. Side deflectors and integrated handguards bring you even more complete wind protection.
Detachable Panniers
No need to buy an expensive set of racks and panniers. The Adventura comes with the luggage you need for the ultimate sport touring adventure. Simply load them up and ride.
J.Juan Dual Front Disc Brakes with ABS
Up front, two-piston calipers clamp down on dual semi-floating discs. Continental ABS has your back should you ever need it. Pirelli Angle GT tires complete this performance package.
High-Carbon Steel Frame
This bike is ready to go anywhere. The high-carbon steel frame is built for strength and durability. The suspension is highly adjustable. The USD fork gives you twelve options for rebound damping. The rear monoshock gives you eight.
Metzler Tires
The included Metzler tires provide the 650 Adventura with excellent durability and abrasion resistance to help you take on long distances on gravel, muddy, or normal road conditions.
Adjustable Upside Down Front Fork
The 650 Adventura is equipped with an upside-down front shock absorber that adjusts depending on different road conditions. The front and rear suspension travel supplies the driver with remarkable comfort during long journeys.
649cc DOHC WITH BOSCH® EFI
This engine is just right for the fastest growing segment of this sport—adventure riding. Having a bulletproof 60hp, 649cc DOHC, counterbalanced parallel twin, with Bosch EFI at your constant beck and call is essential equipment for any adventure.

2022 CFMoto 700CL-X Sport
ACCELERATE TO HAPPINESS
Enter the 700CL-X Sport. For a full dose of excitement, throw a leg over the saddle, thumb the starter, and let your right wrist do what it was made for. What happens next is pure entertainment. Even if you ride it for practical reasons, the only thing that can overtake you are your happy thoughts.
Features may include:
When you start with a clean sheet of paper and the best intentions this is what you get. With its café-racer style and outstanding performance, the 700 CL-X Sport gives you something few motorcycles can—the confidence to show up wherever you want. The ABS, electronic throttle, slipper clutch, and cruise control make this your top pick whether you’re new to the saddle or highly experienced.
Ride Modes, Cruise Control, Auto-Canceling Turn Signals
The 700 CL-X Sport is fitted with two on-the-fly riding modes: Sport and Eco. Sport mode utilizes full engine power and sharp throttle response, while Eco allows for softer throttle inputs and increased fuel efficiency. For those long, open stretches of road, one-touch cruise control lets you rest your throttle hand. Auto-canceling turn signals take your mind off your controls and focus your concentration back on the road.
CF Slipper Clutch
The slipper clutch is the best way to enjoy the ups and downshifts of riding. When downshifting from higher engine speeds, the slipper clutch reduces engine braking force. The clutch slips—just enough—until the engine speed matches the motorcycle’s speed. Transmission is in sync with engine. Engine is in sync with rider.
Brembo Brakes
These brakes are for race day and every day. The front wheel sports dual Brembo Stylema 320mm discs and a beefy 4-piston caliper. The rear disc, sporting a 2-pistion caliper, is a 260mm Brembo Stylema. If these massive brakes don’t instill total confidence, the Continental dual-channel ABS certainly will.
Suspension
If the way it looks impresses you, putting it through its paces will blow your happy mind. Full chromoly steel frame construction creates the rigidity of a performance motorcycle on the hunt for S-curves. The top-of-the-line KYB 41mm, fully adjustable, upside-down fork paired with a KYB link-mounted rear shock create a mean, leaning machine.
Lightweight Frame
The full chromoly steel frame construction is complemented with a lightweight gravity cast aluminum swingarm. Less weight equals more performance.
Wheels and Tires
You can lean on these tires with utmost confidence. Behold the Maxxis MA-ST2. A.K.A. Supermaxx ST. Superb grip. Reliable in wet conditions. Great road feel. Now about those rims. Gorgeous. Need we say more?
Lighting
Lighting is one of the most important safety features of your motorcycle. Full LED lighting with signature DRL (daytime running light) and taillight includes an automatic headlight and turn signal system. You’re not just lighting the way. You’re a beaming presence for everyone to see.
Retro Style
In the spirit of café racer tradition, the Sport version of the CL-X gets clip-on handlebars with bar-end mirrors. The tail section features an optional rider pillion.
Engine
With the flick of your wrist, Bosch® EFI delivers the precise amount of fuel to the 693cc, liquid-cooled, parallel twin unleashing 74 exhilarating horsepower at 8500 rpm. Multiple power modes give you the choice of engine power delivery to suit riding conditions or preferred riding style. ETC (electronic throttle control), a drive-by-wire fuel delivery system, enlists a sensor to read throttle input which is transmitted to the ECU (electronic control unit) for lightning-fast engine response.

An icon among superbikes.
The BMW S 1000 RR led to a revolution in the supersport motorcycle category right from the outset. In the time since, the bike continued to be developed, its tried and tested concept being honed even further and the latest technology added. Because of its impressive power curve and performance, one constant factor remains: it is still a trailblazer today. The S 1000 RR now comes with Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) as standard for even greater riding dynamics and road safety. It is a thoroughbred among sport bikes – whether on the road or on the racing circuit, and its innovative technology allows you to experience its performance with greater intensity and immediacy than ever.
The look of a winner. Or a high-performer. Or a fighter.
The RR is the epitome of a superbike. With its distinctive design features like the split face and asymmetrical front headlamps, it is instantly recognizable. The razor-sharp flyline gives it a look of extreme clarity, its contours and shapes complementing each other superbly. It radiates a love of straights and bends from the front to the rear and its hunger for high-level performance is plain to see. The RR shares its desire for pure acceleration and speed with you.
Winning statistics. Almighty performance.
The S 1000 RR’s liquid-cooled four-cylinder in-line engine is capable of 199 hp (146 kW) at 13,500 r.p.m. and a maximum torque of 83 lb-ft at 10,500 r.p.m. Yet even with this level of performance, the standard Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) ensures significantly greater safety.

Greater performance guaranteed.
Numerous details enable you to experience the performance of the S 1000 RR even more intensively and maintain an even better overview in all traffic situations. The three driving modes ""Rain"", ""Sport"" and ""Race"" ensure optimal coordination of electric throttle, ABS and ASC, even in differing conditions. The DTC Dynamic Traction Control and ABS, both of which now come as standard, ensure even greater safety too. Electric throttle enables the bike's immense power to be dispensed even more finely and directly.


With its exceptionally high resolution, the instrument panel provides a clear display of the selected settings along with road speed and engine speed. As a result you have an optimal overview of the RR's performance and of your settings at all times.

Features may include:
The F 700 GS: The GS Feeling for Everyone.
Carefree motorcycling fun for everyone! With the F 700 GS. Its 75 hp engine and outstanding handling make riding child's play – on any terrain. Due to its low weight and many different seat variants from high to low-slung, it is also particularly suited to smaller riders and beginners as an ideal all-round adventure machine.
More technology for more safety.
Thanks to the Ride-by-Wire electronic control system, the rider can control acceleration and deceleration more easily. Operating the accelerator becomes physically easier, due to an elimination of the mechanical transmission. The Rain and Road riding modes are standard features. The additional Enduro mode is an optional accessory. With ABS as standard and ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment) and ASC (Automatic Stability Control) as special equipment, your ride will not only be more confident, but more comfortable.
Made for you.
As usual, a wide range of options and special equipment are available for the F 700 GS, allowing you to tailor your BMW to your individual preferences. This means you can create your own individual BMW.

KEEPING THE IDEAL GRIP ON ADVENTURE.
Do you love extreme, long tours, even on bumpy roads? Do you enjoy stony paths or the wilderness? Whether it's asphalt, offroad, rocks or sand: the BMW R 1200 GS Adventure has the right answers to every challenge with its light, agile handling. A machine for all those who want to go to their limits and grow beyond them. The R 1200 GS is for the real adventure-lovers among you.
Choose your style.
Dust and mud may be your idea of style when it comes to the R 1200 GS Adventure. With two style packages, it’s easy to make the bike your own.
Design: Impressive presence.
The R 1200 GS Adventure is up for journeys and challenges of all types. With its powerful, robust and dynamic design, one look will tell you all you need to know about its character. Its wind, weather and engine guards lend it a highly distinctive look, with the bike's visual focus moved further to the front. The powerful splash guard on the R 1200 GS Adventure gives it a feisty appearance. It's ready to master any difficulties.
The R 1200 GS Adventure promises to always ride on – no matter what the challenge.
Reliable and powerful.
Regardless of where you're off to, the R 1200 GS Adventure is always a dynamic companion. Inspired by the legendary boxer torque of 92 lb-ft and 125 hp (92 kW) from a water-cooled twin-cylinder four-stroke engine. Its cooling concept rests on a combination of air and liquid cooling. Resulting in efficiency, high torque and reliability.
The wet clutch with anti-hopping function and the electric throttle make the R 1200 GS Adventure the ideal companion for adventure.

A lot of equipment. More riding fun.
An innovative highlight of the R 1200 GS and a ""must-have"" for the modern adventurer – BMW Motorrad Connectivity. This new optional equipment shows you everything about your motorcycle in a smart way and on a 6.5 inch TFT display. Connect your smartphone to your bike via Bluetooth and use functions via the multi-controller on the handlebars such as smartphone-based navigation, accept calls or even make calls, media functions like selecting and listening to music from your smartphone playlist, or use it even more vehicle information intuitively, without becoming too distracted from riding. For some functions, the BMW Motorrad Connected App is also required.
The practical equipment that comes as standard with the touring enduro caters for almost all your needs: two standard driving modes – ""Rain"" and ""Road"" – are available at the press of a button and offer your two entirely different, optimally coordinated driving styles.
Other modes are also available as Ride Modes Pro optional equipment. The corresponding Dynamic and Enduro riding modes ensure greater options on your quest for adventure. With a built in coding plug, the Dynamic riding mode becomes Dynamic Pro and Enduro becomes Enduro Pro.
The fuel tank capacity of 7.9 gallons gives you independence on your journey – for those very long stages. In addition, you have an on-board computer at your disposal: for the perfect journey organization and to display important data like doubled trip computer, average consumption and fuel range. Equally practical is the storage compartment above the tank. With this, any small items you have can be on hand at all times.

2015 BMW S 1000 RR
Welcome to the new Planet Power.
The S 1000 RR revolutionized the supersports class when it first came out in 2009. Now - six years later - it steps up to the very same challenge. The S 1000 RR model year 2015 has been completely revised: BMW Motorrad engineers have entirely revised the bike's technology, design and fittings. The result: in its origins a genuine Double R, on the road a new supersports machine.
A facelift is not enough.
The RR is the epitome of a superbike - and that applies to its design, too. Now in its third generation, you can instantly see its increased power. The profile is razor-sharp and extremely clear, the volume of the contours and shapes perfectly balanced. From the rear to the front section, every trim component has been redesigned - including the headlamp element, where the symmetry has been given greater emphasis.
Increased output, reduced weight.
The new S 1000 RR has an output of 199 hp - 6 hp more than its predecessor. But it is not just its higher rated output that makes the Double R faster and more agile. Weighing in at 450 lbs incl. ABS and traction control, it is some 8.8 lbs lighter than the previous version. Furthermore, it has a newly designed exhaust system as well as a new engine set-up for increased torque, an improved output curve and many other optimized detail
Consistently revised down to the last detail.
In addition to major changes to design and performance, it is primarily the technical details which allow the S 1000 RR to take such a quantum leap forward. The electronic suspension components DDC and DTC have been given a new set-up, as has the entire suspension. This ensures greatly improved traction as well as better feedback to the rider. Optimized riding is enabled by such features as the Shift Assistant Pro (shifting up and down without clutch) and the e-gas throttle actuator for more precise and direct control. The rider operates these new features via the newly designed instrument panel which can be adapted to the specific type of use.
All in all: a new S 1000 RR.
In taking the S 1000 RR a step further for model year 2015, absolutely every component was re-assessed. The result is a superbike what will once again set the benchmark in its class - in other words a genuine Double R.

2022 BMW R 18 B 719 Galaxy Dust Metallic/Titan Silver 2 Metallic
RAW POWER – PURE SOUL
The R 18 B brings together full Boxer power with BMW Motorrad touring history and the emotional character of the R 18 family. The large front end featuring a fork-mounted fairing and low windscreen demonstrate a strong character. The 1802 cc of the black Big Boxer leaves no room for speculation. Still, it’s not all about displacement. The R 18 B goes significantly further. It’s made for customizing. Turn it into your unique bike and bring out the #SoulFuel.
Features may include:
Black tank with double lining and bolted logo
The black tank with available double striping is one of the icons of BMW Motorrad history.
Cases
The integrated side cases provide a capacity of over 7 gallons each. Their stylish shape has been integrated into the R 18 B’s streamlined outline: for an unmistakable bagger look. The perfectly coordinated liners made of a sophisticated leather and canvas material mix are available as part of the accessories range.
Cockpit
Four traditional, analog round instruments are included together with a modern 10.25” TFT display: from fuel level indicator to map navigation, you have all the information available at a glance.
Power Reserve
See what you can feel: the traditional, round instrument illustrates the power reserves you haven’t used yet.
TFT display
The 10.25” TFT color display offers you a range of legible information and maximum functionality.
Marshall Gold Series
Available gray cover grilles and golden Marshall lettering: these are the elements that conceal the refined sound quality from a total of four speakers powered by a 180 watt amp.
Boxer engine
We build it with conviction and plenty of passion. Power, endurance, reliability – simply put: a very special boxer experience.
Front Fairing
First impressions count. And this one is impressive. The front fairing installed on the handlebars provides you with ideal protection from the elements and represents a visual highlight with a high recognition value.

2016 BMW F 800 GT Premium Light White
Typical GT. Unstoppable tour.
Hit the road - the journey begins. The dynamically-designed F 800 GT offers impressive dynamic performance on every ride - whether idyllic suburbs, winding mountain passes or endless highways.
A twist of the throttle and 90 horsepower ensure that you really can leave everyday routine behind you. The water-cooled 2-cylinder in-line engine with a capacity of 798 cc offers remarkable dynamic performance on every trip, achieving smooth power delivery through its low-maintenance toothed-belt drive. A longer rear-wheel swing arm and tighter suspension ensure a high level of ride stability, guaranteeing superb riding impressions.
The F 800 GT also offers control and comfort with suspension and three different seat heights which provide just the right ergonomics for each individual rider. What is more, the optionally available ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment) can be used to adjust the rear rebound-stage damping to road conditions at the press of a button.
Clean lines and a perfectly adjusted touring windshield instantly promise pure riding pleasure.
Safety is the best travel companion. For this reason, the GT supports every brake maneuver as standard with dual-channel ABS - the most sophisticated system in a mid-range motorcycle. For those looking for an even higher level of safety, assistance is provided by the optionally available ASC.
Typical GT. Unstoppable tour.

Honest. Untamed. Air-cooled.
Feel the wind, lean into every curve and experience the freedom in every mile you ride – the BMW R nineT Scrambler empowers you to do your own thing. Tough, unconventional, and against established standards. Made for true characters who want their bike to be pure and minimalistic.
See, hear, feel.
The unique sound of the R nineT Scrambler is a real attention grabber. The classic 1200 cc boxer engine and its high-positioned dual silencer give the bike a powerful voice.
Compared to the R nineT, the handlebars are placed higher and the comfortable seat is repositioned. This ensures a confident and relaxed seating position for every rider. In combination with the slightly longer spring travel, you'll overcome rough spots with ease.
No limits.
Dual sport tires, a high exhaust system, and a relaxed, upright riding position help the Scrambler keep riding where the pavement ends. The 19-inch front wheel, the analog tachometer, a purist steel tank in monolith metallic matte and other unique details turn the Scrambler into a high-quality classic. And with just a few steps you can give the R nineT Scrambler your own individual touch.
Pure Scrambler. Pure BMW Motorrad. The R nineT Scrambler is at the highest level in matters of safety, reliability and quality. Standard ABS and optional ASC provide extra safety.
Make your statement with the R nineT Scrambler.

2022 BMW S 1000 XR Triple Black
THE CHALLENGE OF CURVES AND MILES.
Make no concessions, demand it all. From yourself, but also from your machine. Always fighting for the racing line: every curve a few degrees deeper, a few inches tighter. Mile after mile. With the S 1000 XR, you have a motorcycle that also makes no compromises. It combines athleticism and long-distance performance in perfect form. Its sporty aggressiveness comes from the RR. Its outstanding ergonomics with the upright, relaxed seat position, however, allows you to fight for every curve and straightaway all day. A racetrack that only finishes when you want. How it should be. That is how we view the XR. What about you?
On the racing line – even in the design.
The front fairing and lighting system are defined by sharp edges. Combined with striking beading, they shape the overall line – aggressively and consistently to the finish: it’s no accident that the visually short tail is reminiscent of a sport bike.
The hinted snout, the high flyline, and the comfortable handlebars indicate an insatiable hunger for miles. Miles that are great fun in the long-distance seat position, even after days at a time – also thanks to the revised aerodynamics and fairing. It provides even better protection against the cold, driving noises and the elements. The adjustable windshield means you can keep your eyes on the road, and the odometer, without your helmet shaking.
A curve that makes you addicted: our torque.
The engine of the S 1000 XR is based on the high-performance engine of the RR and was optimized according to the XR for uncompromising long-distance performance: among other things, special camshaft profiles and designated manifolds deliver impressive torque from the middle and the widest usable speed range in its class. The longer gearbox in the upper gears ensures smooth running – which you can feel and hear.
More dynamic thanks to the lower weight.
Dynamism is also a question of mass. Even fully equipped, the S 1000 XR weighs a full 22 lbs less than its predecessors. In the lightest configuration, this bike is ready to ride at just 498 lbs. You won’t miss a single ounce, but you will feel each individual one – on every yard. In the form of better acceleration, higher agility, shorter braking distances, and easier maneuvering.
Features may include:
Engine and performance.
Typical to the XR, the engine is uncompromising on long distances and designed to be sporty.
Dynamic ESA Pro.
A new race-inspired valve technology and a shim package: for unprecedented suspension adjustment range between long distances and the racetrack.
Striking front design with Pro headlight.
Aggressive at all times of day: the fierce, sport front design with LED light.
Accessory range like Carbon engine guard.
Whether it's high-quality milled parts or carbon fibre equipment such as the engine guard: Our M Performance parts from the factory or as accessories are developed for true enthusiasts.
Optimized weight.
The low weight delivers better acceleration and higher agility. In other words: more riding enjoyment – and a sporty head start.
The TFT display with BMW Motorrad Connectivity.
The 6.5” TFT display replaces the instrument panel. BMW Motorrad Connectivity connects smartphone, bike, and helmet via Bluetooth. For navigation, favorite song, and conversations.

2022 KTM 65 SX
FAST HAS NO AGE LIMIT
The KTM 65 SX is sharing the same development strategy as the bigger 2-Strokes. It has everything the bigger bikes do, from a proper clutch and gearbox to the latest WP XACT front forks with revolutionary AER technology, modern, aggressive graphics, and power delivery that sets the benchmark in its class. Like its larger counterparts, the KTM 65 SX has real-world READY TO RACE written all over it.
Features may include:
01. ENGINE & EXHAUST
ENGINE
The KTM 65 SX features cutting-edge 2-stroke technology and an easy-to-shift 6-speed transmission with a hydraulic clutch. Benefitting from a reworked ignition curve, the cylinder, with its pressure-controlled exhaust valve, continues to provide class-leading power and plenty of torque.
02. CHASSIS
FRAME
The modern frame is made from lightweight, high strength chromoly steel profiles and combines maximum longitudinal stiffness with optimum torsional rigidity. It guarantees easy handling and precise cornering, but also outstanding stability.
03. ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
HANDLEBAR
Even young riders will be impressed at the high-quality anodized handlebar made from aluminum alloy. It also has the perfect bend to suit the ergonomics of the KTM 65 SX, and is strong enough to withstand the odd fall over. It also features a foam bar pad on the handlebar brace, which protects the rider in the event of any contact.
04. BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
DECALS
The 2020 KTM SX models feature the latest in-mold graphics, matching the factory-look orange frames and bodywork perfectly. They have a fast and aggressive style that screams READY TO RACE, leaving no doubt as to the bikes' high-performance intentions.

2022 KTM 390 Adventure
The KTM 390 ADVENTURE takes exploration further by merging all-road versatility and proven reliability with real-world performance. Built around a compact 373 cc single-cylinder powerplant with a capable, lightweight chassis and class-leading electronics, the KTM 390 ADVENTURE encourages you to find new frontiers with the unmatched capability and excitement you'd expected from a KTM ADVENTURE machine. Featuring an updated design for 2022, the KTM 390 ADVENTURE is now also visually aligned with the Dakar winning KTM FACTORY RALLY machines.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
A state-of-the-art, liquid cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke 373 cc engine powers this agile machine perfectly into KTM's world of ADVENTURE. Twin overhead camshafts, four valves and electronic fuel injection are integral to the KTM 390 ADVENTURE's outstanding power and together with a balancer shaft, deliver the highest levels of smoothness. Its lightweight and compact construction facilitates straight air intake channels, allowing for a shortened distance for air to flow into the combustion chamber, and beyond for gas flow to the two catalytic converters. Besides the faster movement of air and gases, this also allows the engine to warm up faster. Additionally, the two catalytic converters and the fuel tank ventilation system (EVAP system) improve emission values and prevent fuel vapors from being released into the environment, making the KTM 390 ADVENTURE extremely eco-friendly and compliant with the strict EU5 exhaust emission standards.
CHASSIS
Frame
Similar to the race proven frame of the KTM 450 RALLY, the KTM 390 ADVENTURE features an ultra-lightweight, yet extremely stable trellis frame. It exceeds all requirements for stability and controllability and is the backbone of this nimble adventurer. The forgiving balance of flex and stiffness, combined with a wheelbase of 1,430 (+/-15.5 mm) and a 26.5 degree steering head angle, clearly suggest an offroad oriented layout. It is also the basis of its outstanding straight-line stability and precise and agile steering behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
Full control at your fingertips, thanks to a tapered aluminum handlebar that is perfectly fit for purpose. Not only do the bars provide the ideal riding position when seated or standing, it also provides the perch for the TFT menu switchgear which can be customized to personal preferences. For instance, riders can set their ABS and MTC settings to be easily accessed for quick toggling when the tarmac suddenly runs out.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Bodywork
As minimal as possible and as much as needed. The KTM 390 ADVENTURE features a distinctive KTM-style bodywork, providing excellent ergonomics and an aggressive look inspired by the rally bikes. Ready for adventure, the bodywork is produced in color to help keep its appearance looking fresh, even after scratching. The tank spoilers and rear side panels are slightly wider than the seat for good control and also to reduce wear and tear on the seat. The shape of the fuel tank is optimized to offer the rider freedom of movement and the best control. The headlight mask is as reduced as possible, taking design cues from KTM's rally bike generation to create a slim, lightweight front end. A low front fender assists with good aerodynamics and keeps spray to a minimum when travelling on the road, while a robust engine guard protects the engine and exhaust when venturing off the road into the dirt.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Rider Aids
KTM develops electronic rider aids that provide more control and better performance for riders of all levels of ability, with the intention of enhancing the fun in all conditions.

2020 Husqvarna FC 350
BALANCED PERFORMANCE
With the agility of a 250 and a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, the FC 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, making for a more user-friendly riding experience in all conditions. It is this versatility, paired with intelligent traction and launch control, which makes the FC 350 one of the most multitalented motocrossers on the market.Features may include:
ENGINE
The 350 cc DOHC engine weighs in at only 60 pounds with a maximum power output that rivals 450 cc machines. The engine is specifically designed with performance, weight and mass centralisation as key areas. As a result, all shaft arrangements have been positioned to allow oscillating masses to occupy the ideal center of gravity while all parts are engineered to offer the best performance while adding the least possible weight.
CYLINDER HEAD
The FC 350 features an advanced DOHC cylinder head layout meticulously engineered to deliver every fraction of performance. The internals feature polished camshafts and DLC coated finger followers, resulting in minimal friction and unsurpassed overall performance, allowing the engine to rev freely to 13,400 rpm.
CYLINDER & PISTON
An 88 mm bore and 57.5 mm stroke cylinder features a compression ratio of 14:1 and a large diameter yet lightweight forged bridged-box-type piston. As a result, the low oscillating mass delivers exceptional power, high revs and a very wide power band.
CRANKSHAFT
At the centre of the high-output, high-revving FC 350 engine is a crankshaft featuring a plain big end bearing rotating on two force-fitted bearing shells, ensuring maximum reliability and durability, guaranteeing long service intervals of 100 hours.
FRAME
Engineered with carefully calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex, the frame features improved rider feedback, energy absorption and straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium blue powder coating and standard frame protectors guaranteeing superior protection and durability.
CARBON FIBRE SUBFRAME
The use of carbon fiber strips away weight, improving weight distribution and bringing weight closer to the center of gravity for precise handling. The composition of the material is 30% carbon fiber and the overall 3-piece construction is remarkably light but also very strong for an overall weight of 3.1 pounds. Additionally, a specific rigidity has been calculated in the component for optimal handling and rider ergonomics.

2019 PIAGGIO LIBERTY 150
$2,999.99*
Stock # 0936
Firing on a full cylinder
The single cylinder which powers the Piaggio Liberty 150 can get up to 12.9 hp (9.6 kW) at 7750 rpm and has a torque of 9.58 ft-lbs (13 Nm) at 5250 rpm. And, despite the power, it is extremely economical when it comes to fuel consumption and harmful emissions, certified Euro 4 by the anti-pollution compliance body.
A scooter made for two
The driver of the Piaggio Liberty 150 can be sure of experiencing maximum comfort with the perfect seat-footwell-handlebar combination thanks to a seat height of 787 mm, and a front shield which provides plenty of protection, even in rainy weather. The passenger is not forgotten either, with comfortable, solid fold-away footrests and a long, roomy seat.
Attention to detail
Nothing is left to chance with the Piaggio Liberty 150 from the LED parking lights to the instrument panel which cleverly mixes analogue and digital technology where the large speedometer takes pride of place amongst the LCD multi-function panel. Two compartments create ample storage with a lockable glove box under the rear shield and a space able to easily hold a full-face helmet beneath the seat (accessible by simply pressing a button on the handlebar).

KX™ ENGINE PERFORMANCE
POWER AHEAD
The same championship-proven engine performance found in KX™ motocross bikes is what propels the KX™450X motorcycle.

Engine maps are optimized for cross-country racing, delivering the ideal amount of useable power. Electric start makes starting the engine as easy as a push of a button. A coned disc-spring hydraulic clutch offers a direct feel, light lever action, and consistent performance.

Large-diameter brakes deliver strong stopping power, offering a high level of control.
CROSS-COUNTRY CAPABILITY
TAKE ON TOUGH TRAILS
The KX™450X motorcycle is built to meet the tough demands of cross-country racing. Cross-country wheels (F21""/R18"") are paired with specific Dunlop Geomax AT81 tires developed for GNCC racing. A factory-style skid plate and a convenient side stand both come as standard equipment.
ERGO-FIT® ERGONOMICS
GET THE PERFECT FIT
Slim ergonomics stem from a narrow frame and minimalist bodywork. To help facilitate the perfect fit, the KX™450X motorcycle features ERGO-FIT® adjustability. Four handlebar positions and two footpeg positions allow you to tailor the KX450X to your body size, riding style and preference.

2023 KTM 150 XC-W
Quite literally in a class of its own, the 2023 KTM 150 XC-W is an unlikely underdog in the world of enduro. Proudly featuring KTM's proven 2-stroke engine technology, supreme agility, and surprising power delivery, it helps elevate rider and machine to incredible new heights at all levels of competence. Light enough to be hauled up the hardest of trails, yet packing enough punch to hang on to the big boys, the KTM 150 XC-W commands respect.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Thanks to state-of-the-art engineering, innovative 2-stroke design, and revolutionary TPI fuel injection technology, the 150 cc 2-stroke powerplant is as surprising as it is effective. Delivering class-leading power throughout the entire rev range, the benefit to this compact, lightweight 2-stroke is down to its approachable rideability, making it a great option for those looking to delve into more extreme action, without the intimidation of a bigger 2-stroke.
Cylinder
The KTM 150 EXC cylinder has a bore of 58 mm and with refined port timings and the aid of a sophisticated power valve, provides really smooth and controllable power characteristics. For the EFI application the cylinder features two lateral domes which hold the fuel injectors that supply fuel to the rear transfer ports. The downstream injection guarantees excellent atomization of the fuel with the upstreaming air. Thus, the loss of unburnt fuel is minimal, resulting in less emissions, a more efficient combustion and reduced fuel consumption. A small tube in the back of the cylinder is connected with an intake pressure sensor, which supplies pressure data to the control unit. The cylinder features a power valve unit with a sophisticated mechanism for the lateral support exhaust ports. The exhaust port layout increases engine performance, while the upper contour of the exhaust port has been machined to ensure more accurate port timing. The new cylinder, with TPI technology, produces outstanding performance over the entire range with significantly increased torque compared to its predecessor.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM EXC models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed - not to mention FACTORY RACING style thanks to the striking orange coating. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 900 grams providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
Swingarm
The KTM 150 EXC features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exeptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XC-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
Footpegs
Self-cleaning footpegs prevent mud from clogging up the pegs, even when dragging them through deep ruts. This means your boots maintain their grip, and you maintain your focus on the trail.

You will not find a nicer 5th gen VFR anywhere! This bike looks like it just came off the showroom floor and has been extremely well maintained and tastefully upgraded. There is absolutely nothing that this bike needs and you should expect many thousands of trouble free miles. This is the bike I thought I would keep forever but life changes necessitate downsizing the stable and finding a bike that is more practical for commuting.

Both front and rear suspension have recently been rebuilt by Daugherty Motorsports. The rear shock is a piggyback reservoir type that was revalved and resprung and the front forks were resprung and have the BD20 cartridges. The fork spring weight is 0.95kg/mm and the shock is 1150lb/in; this is for someone weighing approximately 175-200lbs. I weigh 150lbs and it's a little on the stiff side for me, but miles better than the stock suspension.

The bike had a major refresh done recently, which included going through the coolant system, replacing all the seals, thermostats, wax idle unit, etc. The linked brakes were completely rebuilt using all new seals, with full HEL stainless lines, new rotors and new pads. The wheels were powder coated dark grey and new wheel bearings were installed. A VFRness wiring harness was installed to prevent any R/R issues from creeping up. Voltage is rock steady 13.2v just above idle and all through the rev range. Everything that showed any wear was replaced during the refresh!

The tires are brand new Dunlop Roadsmart 4 with less than 100 miles on them. They balanced perfectly with zero weights required and were installed with bridgeport 90 degree valve stems. The battery is brand new and the oil and filter have just been changed. Included are both a GIVI touring screen, the OEM screen, a factory service manual, a lightweight dust cover, and a Givi tank bag that connects to a ring on the fuel filler. There is a fuse block under the seat; currently only a SAE charging pigtail is connected but it is ready to wire for heated grips, power outlets, etc.

Comfort wise this bike is excellent; I have done a 500 mile day and could have kept going. The Sargent seat is fantastic and the removable pillion section affords a decent sized trunk space under the seat cowl, which is easily removable with two quick release ""frankenstein"" bolts. The GIVI touring screen works quite well at my height of 5' 11"" to keep the wind buffeting to a minimum and is a huge improvement over the stock screen. Safety wise you can expect to be as visible as possible between the bright yellow paint, the modulating headlight and the brake light flasher. Say what you will about headlight modulators being obnoxious, but I have personally noticed a huge difference in the amount of motorists that have noticed me and moved out of the way. They turn off at night using an optical sensor to comply with the law, and you could easily tape over or remove the sensor to disable the modulation.

Price: $12,249.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® FE 350s
Possessing a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio while delivering a light and agile feel more similar to a 250, the FE 350s is known for its incredible versatility. The preferred choice of riders searching for the perfect balance of weight and power, this dual-sport machine features ergonomics designed to ensure comfort during extended time in the saddle, with plush WP suspension further enhancing the experience for all riders.

VERSATILE POWER
Engine
When it comes to versatility, the DOHC 350 cc engine is second to none. By sharing much of its architecture with the 250cc engine, the FE 350s delivers a fine balance between 450-rivaling power and lightweight 250 handling.
Cylinder Head
The FE 350s features an advanced DOHC cylinder head layout meticulously engineered to deliver performance and reliability. Internally, the DOHC layout features polished camshafts and low-friction DLC coated finger followers. Together with the lightweight titanium valves - 36.3 mm intake and 29.1 mm exhaust - they aid in delivering optimal performance.
RACE-WINNING SETUP
WP Xplor Front Fork
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for off-road riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping is in the left leg and rebound damping is in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
Hydraulic Brakes
The highest level of quality is guaranteed with the new BRAKTEC braking system, offering the highest level of braking performance while being specifically tailored for enduro riding and delivering a sensitive and modulated feel. GSK wave discs (260 mm disc front and 220 mm rear) complete the high-quality braking package for complete confidence.

Description
This 2018 Black w/pinstripes H-D Softail Fat Boy FLFB is Styling that has been modernized with a smaller ""atomic-era"" headlight nacelle, LED lights, satin chrome finish and duel exhaust. It only has 1504 original miles on it, so barely broke in and it comes with an external preload adjuster and the stiffer frame, but instead of the dual-bending-valve forks, it gets a racing style cartridge. The defining characteristic of the Fat Boy remains its disc wheels. These 18-inchers are updated with a new ribbed look called ""Lakester"" and are shod with wider 160mm front and 240mm rear rubber. Styling remains recognizably Fat Boy, but pushes new boundaries. Don't wait, come on down and take the test ride your gonna love.

2021 Honda Rebel 500
ESCAPE THE ORDINARY
The Honda Rebel 500 is a bike that breaks out from the world of traditional motorcycle style and escapes from the boring boulevard drone. It all starts with a narrow 471cc twin-cylinder engine with plenty of user-friendly power. The blacked-out look, light weight, and low seat height are winners everywhere, and features like Honda's slip/assist clutch help make riding more enjoyable. And where some cruiser-class bikes are only fun if you ride slow, the Rebel 500 is happy to kick it up a notch. You can even get anti-lock brakes. Plus, for 2021, we've added fresh new colors, and our new Rebel 500 ABS SE, a version that comes with a selection of some of our most popular accessories, pre-installed, like our Black Diamond-Stitch Seat, Black Fork Boots and Covers, and a Black Headlight Cowl. So don't let anyone put you into a cage discover a new Rebel 500 and escape the ordinary.
Features may include:
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one's not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone's lineup. It's comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
Developed and perfected in Honda's racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It's technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the 471cc Rebel 500's engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.

2020 KTM 300 XC-W Six Days TPI
THE PINNACLE OF ENDURO
No other brand stands up to the success of KTM when it comes to enduro, and this is clearly evident in the biggest competition on the calendar, the 'International Six Days Enduro' (ISDE). From its humble beginnings, the ISDE has turned into the team world championship of the Enduro scene. This Enduro marathon demands as much from the bikes as it does from the riders, and every year, more than half of them show up on Orange. The 2019 International Six Days Enduro will be held on demanding terrain in Portugal. No chain is stronger than its weakest link, so no compromise can be made for those intent on crossing the finish line. KTM, once again, rises to the challenge with the latest, limited Six Days edition of extra-tough machines. Easily identified by their special Six Days design, these bikes feature an extended list of top-of-the-line components, all specially designed and refined by KTM's own research and development department. These are the ultimate Enduro bikes for the exceptional event.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
KTM sets the benchmark in technology with its vast range of race-winning offroad competition 2-stroke models. Two years after the introduction of the world's first 2-stroke electronically controlled fuel injection offroad models, the success story continues with completely reworked, new generation offroad competition engines, all fitted with the revolutionary TPI system. This further demonstrates KTM's unrelenting commitment to 2-stroke advancement. The benefits are clear: besides huge improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions, the system also removes the need for pre-mixing fuel and re-jetting, meaning that with less effort, the engine always runs smoothly and crisply.
CHASSIS
When it comes to 2-stroke weaponry, keeping weight down is key. It should come as no surprise then that the KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS is one of the lightest, slimmest and most agile enduro machines in its class.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Designed for complete harmony between rider and bike, KTM has exploited the knowledge from decades of race success to create perfect ergonomics on the KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS. Maximum rider comfort and movement in all conditions is guaranteed. Additionally, the bike features a new tail light design which fits perfectly to the new shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Drawing on input from KTM's factory riders, as well as KTM R&D and Kiska Design, the bodywork of the KTM 250 XC-W TPI SIXDAYS pushes the boundaries of progression to the extreme. The result is a shape that achieves complete harmony between rider and bike. The main goal was to provide the optimal contact points that allow a rider maximum freedom of movement and improved handling. The front and rear fenders feature an intelligent I-beam design, guaranteeing maximum stability with the lowest possible weight. The tail light design fits perfectly to the shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier. Additionally, the SIX DAYS edition features a very unique Portugal inlay Graphics design and a standout orange frame.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
KTM XC-W TPI models feature the most modern engine management system of any 2-stroke off-road motorcycle. By reading various sensor data inputs, such as intake and ambient air pressure, throttle valve position and water temperature, the control unit optimizes ignition timing and the amount of fuel to inject at all altitudes and conditions. The KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS edition comes with a handlebar map select switch, which allows to select between a standard and advanced power curve.

2023 Husqvarna® EE5

Price: $5,599.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® EE5
The pioneering EE 5 is the culmination of Husqvarna Motorcycles' rich motocross history and the latest e-technology. This modern, fully-fledged motocross machine features an adjustable electric motor, which is more than capable of rivalling its 50cc fuel-powered competition. Designed for complete beginners through to aspiring young racers, the EE 5 is expertly assembled with premium components throughout and fully customisable based on the riders height and ability, which allows for growth and development in the safest way possible. With no notable engine noise and zero carbon emissions, the EE 5 is more accepted in areas sensitive to sound emissions, making motocross much more accessible to younger riders.
Features may include:
Electric motor
Producing a peak power output of 5 kW, the performance from the EE 5 electric motor is on par with its combustion counterparts. Engineered to be extremely compact and slim, the permanent magnet, air-cooled motor is designed specifically for the EE 5 chassis. The motor is both water and dust proof, which means it is largely maintenance free. With an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), power is delivered directly to the rear wheel and can be further customised by selecting one of six different ride modes.
Multifunctional instrument
Providing essential information at a glance, a multi-functional instrument and display unit is located just in front of the seat. This device is where one of the six ride modes can be engaged, with each one offering different power characteristics to suit beginners through to experienced racers. In addition, the remaining battery charge is clearly displayed.
Frame
A strong, chromium molybdenum steel frame houses the electric drivetrain and is designed with calculated parameters of longitudinal flex and torsional rigidity. This greatly benefits overall handling and suspension action, which ensures precise cornering and outstanding stability.
Handlebar
The tapered NEKEN handlebars are made from high quality aluminium and designed to be strong and stable. With a slim, 18 mm diameter in the grip area, youngsters can enjoy total control on the EE 5 with ODI lock-on grips providing comfort. A cushioning handlebar pad protects the rider during a fall or unexpected impacts.
Bodywork
The bodywork on the EE 5 is designed to be slim and unrestrictive with modern ergonomics. This enhances control, particularly when accelerating and braking, and allows riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time.

A genuine modern classic motorcycle, the Bonneville Bobber perfectly encapsulates the distinctive styling principles, muscular stance, and purposeful engineering attitude of a true British icon.

Perfectly integrating all the hallmark features of a bobber with beautiful detailing, premium finishes and that iconic silhouette. Adding to the stylish look are Bobber-unique bar end mirrors, handlebar risers, gloss black bullet indicators, branded locking fuel cap, and classically-styled twin throttle bodies for minimalistic, stripped back styling, muscular stance and purposeful presence.

This stunning thoroughbred custom classic is the fastest-selling motorcycle in Triumph’s history. The Bobber enjoys peerless authenticity because it’s a genuine factory custom, iconic and authentic, with beautifully styled minimalism, unparalleled heritage, attitude and desirability for an addictive ride that, once it has you, will never let you go.

HIGHLIGHTS
Category defining capability, control and comfort
A unique chassis, suspension and frame, that works alongside the rider-focused technology to deliver a supremely confident, dynamic and comfortable Bobber ride – without compromise.

Innovative and elegant engineering
A first-in-class adjustable riding position includes floating aluminium single seat pan, distinctive ‘swing cage’ with hard tail styling, monoshock suspension, and ‘clean line’ hidden technology.

Thrilling hot rod ride and sound
Category leading torque and power (low-down and across the mid-range) for a thrilling hot rod ride. Short slash-cut twin silencers deliver the Bobber’s distinctive deep, raw British soundtrack.

Features may include:
ABS & SWITCHABLE TRACTION CONTROL
The Bobber incorporates an ABS and switchable traction control system that optimizes the delivery of torque when traction is compromised to maximize rider safety and control.

FLOATING ALUMINIUM SINGLE SEAT PAN
Distinctive, floating aluminum single seat pan with cantilever support arm and seat profile ergonomically optimized and sculpted for comfort, with a beautifully stitched deep foam pad and finished with Triumph branding detail.

RIDE-BY-WIRE
The latest generation ride-by-wire system brings an enhanced level of control to the Bonneville Bobber, with minimal visual impact.

LIQUID COOLING
The modern liquid cooling system provides clean fuel-efficient riding, better fuel economy and a high first major service interval of 10,000 miles.

RIDING MODES
The Bobber has two category leading selectable riding modes, linked to the ride-by-wire system - ‘Road’ and ‘Rain’ for greater control and safety. The two dedicated throttle maps are selected via the handlebar-mounted switch gear.

FIRST-IN-CLASS ADJUSTABLE RIDING POSITION
First-in-class adjustable riding position to suit the size and riding style of the rider, allowing you to tailor the seat position for a dynamic ‘up and forward’ ride, or a ‘down and back’ more traditional Bobber stance.

TORQUE-ASSIST CLUTCH
The torque-assist clutch system brings a light touch and feel to the clutch control of the Bobber, helping reduce clutch lever effort for the rider, making it easier to ride for longer.

LED LIGHTING
The Bobber’s LED rear light, indicators and number plate light are incorporated in keeping with its minimalistic look to provide a distinctive light pattern and greater power efficiency for long-term durability. The Bobber Black also features a full LED headlight with daytime running light.",like new,gas,2298,manual,bobber,red,clean,1200,,,,,,

2022 KTM 890 Duke
THE SCALPEL
The KTM 890 DUKE redefines the word 'sharp' by adding an extra edge. Powered by an 889 cc parallel-twin nestled into one of the lightest and most compact chassis around, the KTM 890 DUKE boasts the agility you'd expect from a 600 cc, but with the meaty punch of a bigger twin. It doesn't rewrite the mid-sized naked bike rule book. It obliterates it.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The LC8c engine shares a great deal of its ferocity with the ultra-sharp KTM 890 DUKE R. Boasting a hard-hitting 115 Hp and 92 Nm, this compact, liquid-cooled 8 valve powerplant, is the most compact twin in class punching way above its weight in terms of output.
CHASSIS
Frame
The incredible handling characteristics of the KTM 890 DUKE are founded on the dynamic, loadbearing design of the tubular chassis. Engineers had one goal in mind, and that was to keep the chassis as rigid and compact as possible for sharper turn-in and greater lean angles, allowing it to slice through the turns with extreme responsiveness.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
A tapered aluminum, 760 mm wide handlebar puts you in full control. It's adjustable, with 4 positions on the triple clamp and can be rotated in three further positions for that perfect riding position.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
TFT dashboard
Like all pilots, DUKE riders need easy access to information. In that regard, the KTM 890 DUKE features an intuitive multicolor, light variable TFT dashboard. Best of all, as the revs rise, the display bars change color to indicate when to shift, either spurring you on or warning you that the engine is too still cold for flat-out backroad attacks.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Rider Aids
The KTM 890 DUKE has adopted a vast swathe of rider aids found on the blistering KTM 890 DUKE R, and further refined them to be more user and road-friendly, without hindering any performance.

2018 V-STROM 1000XT
Introduced in 2002, the V-Strom 1000 expanded the popularity of motorcycles in the adventure-category. When a more proficient V-Strom 1000 ABS debuted in 2014, it was also embraced by riders around the world. To reemphasize the V-Strom’s leadership in this category, Suzuki applies new technology and practical experience to the new 2018 V-Strom 1000XT.
Always a good citizen, this new V-Strom has refined systems to maintain engine performance and great fuel economy while achieving world-wide emission standards. To emphasize Suzuki’s adventure heritage the V-Strom’s exterior has undergone a transformation giving the motorcycle a hint of its lineage and a renewed call for adventure. That fresh styling also contributes to functionality and joins the new Motion Track Anti-lock* & Combined Brake System and other features to bring rider assist technology to a new group of adventure riders.
Like every V-Strom before it, the equipment, the appeal and value of the 2018 V-Strom 1000XT will be recognized by experienced and enthusiastic riders. If you want to enjoy a trouble-free adventure as well, join them on a V-Strom.
*Depending on road surface conditions, such as wet, loose, or uneven roads, braking distance for an ABS-equipped vehicle may be longer than for a vehicle not equipped with ABS. ABS cannot prevent wheel skidding caused by braking while cornering. Please drive carefully and do not overly rely on ABS.
KEY FEATURES
Liquid-cooled, 1037cc, 90O V-Twin engine delivers strong engine performance while achieving world-wide emissions requirements without any reduction in horsepower.
A new, five-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) provides vehicle spacial information to the innovative Motion Track Anti-lock* & Combined Brake System.
New fairing styling retains the vertically stacked headlights, new adjustable windshield, and iconic Suzuki DR-Big styling that brings true adventure style and real-world function.
New spoke-style wheels with tubeless radial dual-purpose tires plus the new, tapered, large diameter handlebars deliver the function that validates their exploration style
Refined multi-function, illumination-adjustable instrument panel delivers a wide range of vehicle information and aids in selecting the Suzuki Traction Control* system modes.
Sturdy chassis has integrated mounting points for unified Suzuki V-Strom luggage that’s is easy to clip on and off, and keeps the motorcycle trim when ready for touring.

2023 Husqvarna FX 450
Ride smoothly towards victory
Benefitting from multiple technical upgrades for 2023, the FX 450 retains its class-leading on-track performance and continues to headline the Husqvarna Motorcycles off-road line-up. With an all-new engine that not only produces a broad spread of usable power, but also positions the engine shaft arrangements at the ideal centre of gravity to centralise mass, accentuating the lightweight feel of the FX 450. Aiding this agile feel is the new chassis which has been developed and manufactured using advanced engineering techniques to offer improved anti-squat behaviour for enhanced handling and manoeuvrability. Retaining the advanced electronics and high-quality components throughout, the FX 450 is complete with a new flatter seat and finished with functional bodywork adorned with white, yellow, and grey graphics inspired by the Swedish heritage of the brand.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The FX 450 engine benefits from advanced engineering techniques to deliver maximum performance. For 2023, the engine is tilted two degrees backwards for significantly improved anti-squat behaviour from the chassis while further aiding the centralisation of mass for improved overall handling. Servicing of the FX 450 engine is made easier compared to previous models thanks to the addition of service markers on the engine cases. Lighter for 2023, the 450 cc 4-stroke engine weighs just 59 lb.
Cylinder head
The redesigned SOHC cylinder head is incredibly compact with the camshaft positioned as close to the centre of gravity as possible for significantly improved handling and agility. A new, more durable fine punched cam chain runs on low-friction chain guides for optimal efficiency and improved reliability with a single oil spray jet guaranteeing effective cooling. The lightweight valves are actuated via a rocker arm and feature timing specifically designed to deliver precise levels of torque and throttle response.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 3.9 lb. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
Triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.

MOST VERSATILE SPORT TOURER
The most performance, versatility and value in one motorcycle - the FJ-09 with its 3-cylinder engine, Traction Control and a long list of sport touring features dominates the competition.Features may include:
Stunning 3-cylinder Engine
847cc liquid-cooled, in-line 3-cylinder, DOHC, 12-valve engine, derived from the award winning FZ-09. This engine combines high-tech components, including YCC-T and Yamaha D-Mode, with a crossplane concept crankshaft to deliver an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character.
Advanced Engine Control
Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) is Yamaha's exclusive ride-by-wire throttle system, derived from MotoGP technology. YCC-T works in unison with an updated Traction Control System (TCS) to give the rider responsive throttle feel with the security of traction control for roads with less than ideal traction.
Practicality Plus Performance
Touring amenities include a height-adjustable windshield, side fairing, adjustable riding position, 12V electrical outlet and a generous 4.8 gallon fuel tank. The FJ-09 is ideal for the daily commute, short fun rides, or weekend getaways.
Powerful, Controllable Brakes
Modern radial-mount four-piston front calipers squeeze 298mm rotors for exceptional stopping ability, while the anti-lock brake system (ABS) works to help prevent wheel lock during hard deceleration.
Top Shelf
A modern and stylish LED headlight offers superior visibility and complements the FJ-09's design. Multi-function dot matrix LCD instrument panel is designed to visually relay data to the rider quickly and clearly, including fuel consumption info and gear position.
Ready to Travel
Slim-design hard bags, a Genuine Yamaha Accessory, provide storage convenience, as does an accessory top case.

2022 Honda CRF50F
EASY TO LEARN. HARD TO FORGET.
Every great rider starts somewhere. Most of them, on a CRF50F. It's just the right size for younger riders, with the perfect combination of features to make learning as entertaining as riding. The four-stroke engine provides smooth power delivery that's easy to harness, and the automatic clutch means riders can focus on the fundamentals without worrying about stalling. Along the way, an adjustable throttle limiter and keyed ignition lets you control its power output. And this year, it comes with new graphics inspired by our champion-motocrossers. The CRF50F is a learning tool, a bonding opportunity, and nonstop fun.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
DURABLE, LOW-MAINTENANCE ENGINE
If there's one thing you can count on with a Honda, it's the engine. The CRF50F's Honda four-stroke is famously reliable. That cuts down on frustration and hassles.
CONVENIENCE
AUTOMATIC CLUTCH
Because there's no clutch lever to master, new riders don't have to worry about stalling. That makes the CRF50F the perfect tool for learning to shift. In addition, the smooth transmission offers three gear ratios.
CONVENIENCE
KEYED IGNITION
A removable key helps ensure younger riders can't ride without an adult's supervision. Got their homework done early? Let's go riding!
ENGINEERING
ADJUSTABLE THROTTLE LIMITER
Set the top speed by turning a screw. That helps keep new riders from going too fast, too soon, and lets you match the CRF50F's power output to the rider's skill level.
RUGGED STEEL FRAME
New riders are hard on equipment, especially when they're just starting out. That's why the CRF50F uses a strong steel frame that's built to handle the bumps and dings of off-road riding.
STYLING
TOUGH BODYWORK
Learning to ride is all about well, learning. And that can be tough on a bike. So we made the CRF50F even tougher. With plastic fenders, tank and other body parts, it's designed to shrug off dings and scrapes. And with styling inspired by its pro-motocross big brothers, the CRF50F looks like a champ too.

2023 KTM 250 SX-F

The 2023 KTM 250 SX-F continues its assault on the highly-competitive 250 cc class. Featuring a truly user-friendly package engineered to satisfy all riders, from novice to pro, it continues the trend of being undisputedly READY TO RACE at any level. Delivering a knock-out power-punch, more stability in a straight line, and with more electronic upper cuts in the bag, the 2023 KTM 250 SX-F is ready to take on the 250 cc class and dominate it.
Features may include:
Easy suspension adjustment
Get dialed in! The 2023 KTM SX range boasts totally tool-free suspension setup at both ends. Thanks to an all-new shock absorber design featuring hand-adjustable dual compression control, it allows riders to adjust high- and low-speed settings in a matter of seconds. On the front end, the forks are also easily adjusted thanks to a single air pressure preload valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. We'll even throw the air pump in as standard.
More Usable Power
Weighing in at a lightweight 57.5 lb, this mid-weight powerhouse churns out a remarkable payload of explosive horsepower, making it the undisputed performance leader in the 250 cc 4-stroke class. The engine in the 2023 KTM 250 SX-F has also been carefully designed and tuned to best suit the performance and handling characteristics of the overall package, bumping up power in the mid-range and the top-end.
Ergonomics
The 2023 KTM SX and SX-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high grip seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. The polyamide reinforced aluminum subframe further enhances rider feel and feedback.
Mass Centralization
Ready to rip your arms out of the sockets? Together with the benefits of mass centralization and an overall lighter feel, the anti-squat behavior of the chassis is significantly improved by changing the backbone of the steel frame concept. In layman's terms, the 2023 KTM 250 SX-F gets its power down perfectly when tearing out of corners.
Energy Absorption
Besides the expertly crafted, hydro-formed, laser-cut, and robot-welded frame being engineered to provide exceptional rider feedback and straight-line stability, it consists of specifically calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex. This means the frame acts as a shock absorber of sorts, making for a less harsh ride, resulting in less rider fatigue over many hard laps.

Make: Suzuki
Model: RM-Z250

Comments for this 2021 Suzuki RM-Z250:
Low hours!!! 15-20!!! A few extras. Stock and aftermarket exhausts. Oil change parts, spark plugs, Tuner box and lead.
2021 Suzuki RM-Z250
The choice of wise professionals and privateers everywhere, the 2021 RM-Z250 is ready for battle. The agile RM-Z250 combines the sleek, race-ready appearance of the RM-Z450 with a versatile engine and responsive chassis to deliver superior performance. Using Suzuki's RUN, TURN and STOP philosophy, factory engineers have made the RM-Z250 a formidable competitor.
The RM-Z250 has always set the standard as the best handling 250 on the track. Fed by a dual injector EFI system, a center-port cylinder head and an AMA-compliant exhaust, the RM-Z250's engine delivers strong, usable power through the entire rev-range.
The twin-spar aluminum frame and hydro-formed swingarm carry a KYB-supplied suspension that includes a coil spring fork and a shock with four-way damping force adjustment. Strong brakes and ergonomically shaped bodywork that helps keep the rider in control as the RM-Z250 carves up the racetrack.
Tuning the fuel injection and ignition for maximum performance is easy thanks to Suzuki's smartphone-based MX-Tuner 2.0 and proven fuel-coupler system. Suzuki's Winning Balance is on display with the 2021 RM-Z250 as it maintains its own high standard for cornering performance.
Features may include:
Superb Engine Performance
Center-port cylinder head increases output and throttle response
Dual fuel injector system boosts high rpm power
Traction management system helps the bike hook up
Suzuki Holeshot Assist Control (S-HAC) gets you out front
ENGINE
Fitted with a center-port cylinder head, the fuel-injected, 249cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-valve, DOHC engine remains proven and reliable.
The engine delivers strong peak power and superb throttle response through the entire rev range.
The cylinder head features a refined intake port shape and finish that fine-tunes the fuel/air charge into the combustion chamber to increase engine output.
TRANSMISSION & DRIVE
The five-speed transmission's second gear ratio and overall final ratio matches the engine's stronger output for outstanding acceleration and top speed.
True to Suzuki transmission standards, the gear shift operation is smooth and precise. Carefully designed parts like the precisely machined shift cam and corresponding gears create a transmission a racer can rely on.
The multi-plate, wet-clutch uses a rack-and-pinion clutch release mechanism for precise feel of the engagement and disengagement points while riding.
CHASSIS
The RM-Z250 features a frame and swingarm design that continues Suzuki's reputation for creating the best-handling motocross motorcycles.
The aluminum alloy, twin-spar frame combines cast and extruded sections to achieve superior front-and-rear weight distribution, while balancing strength and weight.
The 2021 RM-Z250 frame is 370 grams (0.8 pounds) lighter but has a 10 percent increase in torsional rigidity as compared to the prior generation frame.
The engine's position in the frame is rotated up so the crankshaft sits higher in the chassis to further the bike's nimble handling characteristics.
The rear, upper engine mounts are outboard of the cylinder head to increase rigidity and allow a direct intake path to the engine.
The engine mount material is changed to aluminum, rather than steel, for reduced weight.
The swingarm is shaped using an innovative hydroforming process that maintains strength but weighs 0.6 pounds (270 grams).

2023 Husqvarna TC 65
Set your sights on new horizons
For many young racers the TC 65 will be their first experience of a motocross machine equipped with a manual clutch and gearbox. Ensuring all riders enjoy a smooth transition as they move away from an automatic motorcycle, a lightweight hydraulic clutch and precise six-speed gearbox work together to ensure simple and consistent shifting. The TC 65 is complete with high quality, premium components fitted as standard.
Features may include:
Full-size performance
Engine
Featuring the latest in 2-stroke technology, the TC 65 is highly competitive in the 65cc class. Apart from using the lightest and most durable materials, the engine features a pressure controlled exhaust valve which contributes in delivering top level performance. Additionally, the engine features a manual 6-speed transmission and hydraulic clutch allowing the rider to have full control of the power delivery.
Cylinder
The high performance cylinder is made from lightweight and durable aluminum and incorporates a pressure controlled exhaust valve (PCEV) which provides unrivalled performance giving the young motocross rider a distinct advantage.
Clutch
The reliable hydraulic clutch system from Formula offers improved durability, near maintenance-free operation, and perfect action at all times. Free play is constantly compensated so the pressure point and function of the clutch remain identical in cold or hot conditions, as well as over time.
Cutting edge chassis
Frame
The high strength chromium molybdenum steel frame integrates carefully calculated parameters of longitudinal flex and torsional rigidity to benefit handling and suspension functionality. It guarantees easy handling and precise cornering, along with outstanding stability. The subframe is connected to the frame by 4 screws and is made of lightweight aluminum.
WP XACT Front Suspension
Featuring the latest in suspension technology, the TC 65 is fitted with a revolutionary WP AER 35 fork. Besides being very light weight, the 35 mm USD forks feature exceptional damping and comfort characteristics allowing the rider to push the limit with complete confidence. With 215 mm of wheel travel, the air unit in the left fork leg can also be adjusted easily with the use of an air pump for rider preference, weight or track conditions.
WP PDS Rear Shock
Linked directly to the swingarm, the WP monoshock is ideally matched to the front forks for the perfect balance and damping characteristics. Additionally, the rear shock offers 270 mm of suspension travel and is fully adjustable, allowing it to be tailored to rider preferences or track conditions.
Premium quality standard
Graphics

2023 Yamaha YZ 250 X Single-Cylinder 249

Price: $7,999.00
Description:

2023 Yamaha YZ250X
TWO-STROKE HEART, ENDURO SOUL
Featuring a powerful 250cc two-stroke engine and renowned high performance chassis, the YZ250X was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Two-Stroke Power: Tuned for Enduro Racing
The YZ250X is optimized for the unique demands of Hare Scrambles and GNCC® racing. The Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS™)-equipped 249cc two-stroke engine is mated to a wide-ratio five-speed transmission for the ultimate cross country power plant.
Advanced Motocross-Derived Chassis
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. The industry-leading fully adjustable Speed Sensitive System KYB® spring-type front fork is matched with a fully adjustable high performance KYB® long-travel rear shock, both tested and tuned specifically for the needs of cross country racers.
ENGINE
Exhilarating Two-Stroke Power
The 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine is lightweight, compact and fun, with an incredibly wide, hard-hitting powerband.
Tuned for GNCC® Competition
The YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, revised YPVS™ timing and a model-specific digital CDI unit compared to its motocross sibling—all focused on creating a broad, usable power delivery specifically suited to cross country and enduro-style competition.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
YZ250-Based Frame
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight.
Industry-Leading KYB® Fork
The fully adjustable KYB® 48mm forks feature the Speed-Sensitive System which uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling, superb bump absorption and 11.8 inches of suspension travel. Additionally, a newly adopted scraper between the dust and oil seal improves reliability in cross country conditions.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy ""gripper""-type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.
Cross Country Features
The YZ250X is focused on cross country competition with an 18-inch rear wheel, wide-ratio gearing, standard side stand, sealed O-ring chain, reserve fuel petcock, and newly adopted scraper between the fork's dust and oil seal, all adding up to exceptional cross country performance.
NEW FOR 2023
Improved Rider Ergonomics
To increase rider confidence in challenging cross country conditions, new smoothly integrated body panels, more narrow fuel tank design, slimmer shroud width and flatter seat all combine to enable greater freedom of movement forward and back, allowing the rider to easily shift body weight for better control.
Bold New YZ Styling
Along with the slimmer, more aggressive bodywork, a new front and rear fender design and new radiator shrouds all integrate with a bold new graphics scheme to highlight the YZ family pedigree. Premium Yamaha graphics are now embedded to provide excellent durability and scratch resistance.

2022 Husqvarna® FE 501s
Limitless Dual-sport
The FE 501s is refined in the most impressive way and houses the strongest engine in the Husqvarna dual-sport range. Despite having large internal moving components, a counter balance shaft keeps vibration to a minimum, so you can enjoy its seemingly limitless power for hours on end. As on all Husqvarna Motorcycles, high quality finishes and premium components ensure the FE 501s meets the highest levels of quality and craftsmanship.
Features may include:
TITANIC POWER
ENGINE
The most powerful engine in the Husqvarna Motorcycles FEs line-up, the 510.9 cc power plant is more advanced than ever while only weighing 64.8 lbs. Delivering colossal performance in all conditions, the FE 501s power is controlled with a lightweight 6-speed transmission and DDS (Dampened Diaphragm Steel) clutch.
State-of-the-art chassis
FRAME
The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium gray powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
PRECISE HANDLING
WP XPLOR FRONT FORK
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for enduro riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping in the left leg and rebound damping in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance. A new oil bypass in the outer tube reduces friction for a smoother, consistent travel through the stroke and a revised cartridge joint offers added damping performance.
PREMIUM TECHNOLOGY
TOOL-LESS AIR FILTER ACCESS
The airbox is designed with precisely positioned inlet ducts aimed at preventing air deformation and ensuring maximum airflow and filter protection. The air filter is easily accessed, without tools, by removing the left side panel. Easy maintenance is guaranteed by the Twin Air filter and filter cage design that features a simple fail proof mounting system for safe and accurate filter installation.

2019 Honda® CB1000R ABS
PERFORMANCE HAS A STYLE ALL ITS OWN.
An inline-four streetbike is truly a thing of beauty. It’s all business, and you never get tired looking at it. Simply put, our CB1000R is the best open-class naked streetfighter we’ve ever produced. It has cutting-edge Neo-Sports Café styling, and a high-revving 998cc four-cylinder engine that’s specially tuned for midrange and top-end power. All in all, the CB1000R is light, powerful, responsive and an absolute blast to ride. So get ready to get noticed, on our 2019 CB1000R.
Features may include:
INLINE FOUR ENGINE
The CB1000R’s powerful 998cc DOHC four-cylinder engine uses an architecture and layout proven on Honda’s Superbikes. Forged (not cast) pistons make it as strong as it is powerful.
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
This innovative design hooks up tight to get all the CB1000R’s power to the ground, yet still offers a light pull at the clutch lever. Plus, the slipper design helps mitigate wheel hop during aggressive downshifts and deceleration.
OPEN RIDING POSITION
We call it the rider triangle—where your butt hits the seat, where your feet rest on the pegs, and where your hands grip the bar. By opening up the triangle on the CB1000R, you sit up a little straighter, which gives you a higher vantage point. Plus, most riders will find it a little more comfortable, too.
STEEL BACKBONE CHASSIS
The CB1000R features a unique frame design. The main mono-backbone component is steel, and that joins up with split-tightening aluminum pivot plates. You get the basis for excellent handling along with lightweight design.

2022 CFMoto 650NK
MORE RIDE ABILITY
The 650NK gives you everything you're looking for in a midsize motorcycle modern styling, great comfort, and refined performance. This motorcycle is a pleasure to ride all day long. The meticulously engineered 649cc parallel twin keeps giving. And thanks to the sport-tuned suspension, you can keep taking all the curves you want. With this motorcycle it's time to take your riding ability to a new level.
Features may include:
Carving corners requires attention to detail that doesn't cut any corners. We started with a great foundation a rigid, high-carbon steel frame. Housed in the belly of the beast is a 649cc engine paired with a buttery smooth 6-speed gearbox. A slipper clutch is a great friend to those who enjoy aggressive downshifts. Top-shelf J.Juan brakes and Pirelli Angle GT tires hint at the level of rider you have the potential to be.
TFT Display
The 650NK features a large, 5-inch TFT display. Bright sunshine? You'll have no issues with glare. Overcast skies? Screen brightness adjusts automatically. The full-color LCD instrument display delivers at-a-glance information, including rpm, gear, speed, even phone connectivity. Two interfaces differentiate your riding modes.
Pirelli Tires
The Pirelli Angle GT was chosen for its excellent feel, high degree of stability, and excellent wear characteristics. What's more, it performs superbly in cold and wet conditions. This is your racetrack-capable sport touring tire perfectly capable on any paved road you have in mind.
CF-SC Slipper Clutch
Downshift as you enter a corner. Upshift, and accelerate as you exit. The slipper clutch makes the transition seamless. When downshifting from higher speeds, the slipper clutch reduces engine braking force. Engine speed quickly matches motorcycle speed no need to worry about rear wheel hop.
Engine
Power is central to your riding experience. And 60 horsepower makes the 650NK the middleweight champion. The 649cc parallel twin is a DOHC, 4-valve per cylinder design. Liquid cooling keeps engine temperatures where they should for optimal performance.
BOSCH EFI System
BOSCH is one of the world's most respected names in electronic fuel injection. The BOSCH EFI system chosen for the 650NK contributes to effortless riding. Enjoy quick starts at lower temperatures, instant throttle response, lower emissions, and excellent fuel consumption.
Semi-Dry Sump
The semi-dry sump provides the bike with continuous lubrication. The engine is never starved of oil at those critical times when lubrication is so critical. At 8750 rpm, your engine will be screaming with joy, not pain.
LED Lights
See and be seen. You're not just lighting the road. You're a beacon of light for others to see. The bike's LED headlights provide optimum visibility and a clean aesthetic.
KYB Suspension Components
If you're keen on leaning into corners, you'll be happy to hear about this suspension. We paired a KYB telescopic fork with a KYB rear monoshock for performance that's highly responsive to rider input.
J.Juan Brake System
Great brakes make you a better rider and inspire more confidence. That's why we chose these binders from J.Juan for the 650NK. Up front you get a pair of 300mm discs, each with a 2-piston caliper. The rear is a 240mm disc sporting a beefy single-caliper piston.

2023 Husqvarna® TE 300 Heritage

Price: $11,299.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® TE 300 Heritage
Go where few have gone before on a machine with world championship winning pedigree - the TE 300. Designed with a full focus on performance, and capable of scaling the most technical climbs, this lightweight model is undeniably superior in its natural habitat. Remaining at the forefront of 2-stroke development, the TE 300 continues to utilise proven electronic fuel injection for smooth, controllable power, and impressive torque. New, blue and yellow graphics, inspired by the Swedish heritage of the brand, underline the continued evolution of the TE 300 and create a truly distinctive look.
Features may include:
Unmatched performance
Engine
The 300 cc 2-stroke engine in the TE 300 is the flagship of the Husqvarna Motorcycles enduro range. Featuring precisely positioned shaft arrangements for optimal mass centralization, a counter balancer shaft reducing vibration, a twin-valve controlled power valve and electronic fuel injection, it is the benchmark when it comes to enduro performance.
State-of-the-art chassis
Frame
The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium white powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
Composite carbon fibre subframe
The carbon composite subframe is unique to Husqvarna Motorcycles and showcases advanced production technology and innovation. Using 70% polyamide and 30% carbon fibre, the 2-piece subframe has a total weight of just over 2.2 lb (1 kg). With the help of computational dynamics, specific rigidity was engineered into the light and robust subframe, delivering outstanding handling and rider comfort.
Nimble handling
WP XPLOR front fork
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for off-road riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping is in the left leg and rebound damping is in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
WP XACT rear shock
Featuring a new main piston and updated base setting to match the new frame and front end, the WP XACT shock provides advanced damping characteristics to the new range. The compact and lightweight shock features a pressure balance inside, ensuring consistent damping and superior rider comfort. Using the same linkage progression found in the Husqvarna Motocross range, the rear end now sits lower, for improved control in extreme enduro conditions. The fully adjustable component delivers 11.8 in rear wheel travel, as well as unrivalled traction, feeling and energy absorption.
Premium technology
Map switch
By using the MAP SELECT SWITCH, the engine characteristics can be tailored to modify the power delivery according to rider preference, conditions and terrain. It has two settings which can be toggled on the fly, namely, Map 1, for standard and full power, and Map 2, for softer power and delayed ignition timing for terrain with less traction.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 KTM 250 XC-W
The KTM 250 XC-W is the ultimate combination of power and rideability and sets a clear benchmark for intuitive handling, unique style, and top performance. Thanks in part to its class-leading WP suspension, this extreme machine continues to reach new heights, clearly demonstrating KTM's unrelenting commitment to 2-stroke development. Developed with feedback from factory riders, the KTM 250 XC-W offers excellent rider feedback, making it a stellar choice for pro and amateur riders alike.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The 250cc 2-stroke engine has plenty of power and torque but remains light enough for riders to muscle their way through the toughest obstacles. Thanks to state-of-the-art engineering, innovative 2-stroke design, and revolutionary TPI fuel injection technology, and a 13:52 re-gear, the powerplant is even more refined than ever before. The compact and lightweight 2-stroke is a great choice for offroad riders who want usable enduro performance that is ready to conquer in the most extreme terrain.
Cylinder
The cylinder on the KTM 250 XC-W has a bore of 72 mm and is fitted with a sophisticated power valve, providing ultra-smooth and controllable power characteristics. Being fuel-injected, the cylinder features two lateral domes which hold the fuel injectors, supplying fuel to the rear transfer ports. The downstream injection guarantees excellent atomization of the fuel with the upstreaming air. Thus, the loss of unburnt fuel is minimal for fewer emissions, more efficient combustion, and reduced fuel consumption. The cylinder also features a state-of-the-art power valve unit with a sophisticated mechanism for the lateral support exhaust ports. The exhaust port layout increases engine performance, while the upper contour of the exhaust port has been machined to ensure more accurate port timing.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM XC-W and XCF-W models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed - not to mention FACTORY RACING style thanks to the striking orange coating. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 900 grams providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
Swingarm
The KTM 250 XC-W features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exeptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XC-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
Footpegs
Self-cleaning footpegs prevent mud from clogging up the pegs, even when dragging them through deep ruts. This means your boots maintain their grip, and you maintain your focus on the trail.

2022 Honda CRF250F
CHAMPION-INSPIRED. FAMILY-APPROVED.
There's no surprise that recent popularity for the CRF250F has been so high; it's one of the best ways to get out and enjoy nature. The fuel-injected engine offers reliable power across a wide powerband, even in cold weather and higher altitudes, within a sturdy twin-spar frame that's lightweight and perfectly sized for most riders. With new graphics inspired by our podium-topping motocrossers, the 250F looks as good as it rides. It's ready with the performance to lead the pack, and the group ride.
Features may include:
ENGINEERING
SINGLE-CYLINDER ENGINE
A single is the perfect choice for a bike like the CRF250F. It's light, simple, fuel-efficient, and features plenty of power and torque in all areas, along with smooth power delivery ideal for a wide range of rider experience.
CLEAN-RUNNING ENGINE
Another benefit of fitting the CRF250F with fuel injection? Now it even meets California's stringent CARB emissions standards for off-road motorcycles good news for everyone.
HANDLING
STRONG, LIGHT TWIN-SPAR FRAME
The CRF250F gets a tubular-steel twin-spar frame that's both light and tough.
18-INCH REAR WHEEL
A 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheel give you a wide selection of tire choices for trail riding.
CONVENIENCE
ELECTRIC STARTER
Turn the key, push the button, and let's go riding! Electric starting is a big help on cold mornings, or if you need to restart out on the trail. Honda's proven system makes riding just that much more fun.
COMFORT
COMFORTABLE SEAT POSITION
With a long, motocross-style seat, you can move forward and back, left and right with ease, helping you navigate changing terrain in comfort.
COUNTERBALANCED ENGINE
Because it features a counterbalancer, the CRF250F's engine is a smooth runner. You get the narrow overall width and power advantages of a single along with the smoothness of a multi-cylinder bike.
STYLE
MX STYLING
Honda's CRF450R and CRF250R are two of the hottest motocross bikes on the circuit. And they're some of the coolest looking. We gave the CRF250F plenty of that racing DNA when it comes to style. This is one bike you'll be proud to ride!

You simply won't find a Thruxton 900 this clean out there! Come swing a leg over this beautiful 900cc twin and take it for a spin. The paint on this bike is flawless! Triumph has always knocked it out of the park with it sleek style, butter smooth transmission! We highly recommend you stop by our store and check out our huge selection of motorcycles today!
2016 Triumph Thruxton
The Thruxton is born of the cafe racer culture that dominated motorcycling in the 1960s
Performance
The cafe racers were built to perform, not just to look good.
Today, this 865cc parallel twin puts out a healthy 69PS with 69Nm of torque at its peak, with plenty available at low revs so you get most use out of it.
Fuelling is controlled by a sophisticated computer programmed management system for clean emissions and a smooth, predictable throttle response.
Configuration
The basic format is the same as the current Bonneville, with 360 degree firing intervals, double overhead cams, eight valves, twin balance shafts and fuel injection. So you know it's a thoroughly modern engine that, despite its convincing old-school looks, easily meeting Triumph's high standard of reliability, durability and efficiency.
Features may include:
STYLING
Sound
It's the sound and feel of the engine that matters, from the thumping thrust of the generous low rev torque to the eager high revs and the purring, even exhaust note. So distinctive to the parallel twin.
Bodywork
We used classic 1960s paint schemes with period sports stripes and fitted a typical single-seat, or so it looks thanks to the rear cover. In actual fact a passenger can enjoy the ride on a Thruxton too.
Handlebars
Low and narrow 'Ace' handlebars, named after London's famous Ace Cafe, with classic bar-end mirrors sit behind a colour-coded flyscreen.
Instruments
Twin instrument pods sitting high on their top yoke mounting position.
Engine
The engine and transmission has been engineered with the look of the classic Triumph twins in mind. Even the fuel injection has been moulded so you get the appearance of a pair of carburettors. And there are double overhead camshafts despite what looks like a pushrod tube at the front of the engine, just like the cafe racers of the 60s used to have.
Frame
All of our extensive chassis experience and technology has gone into the Thruxton's simple tubular steel construction. Providing easy, neutral steering and exceptional balance even at low speeds.
Suspension
We fitted 41mm forks and chromed rear shocks and retuned them for a firmer ride and tighter control in high speed corners. The shocks include adjustability for spring preload for carrying a passenger or to suit your riding style.
Wheels, Tyres and Brakes
We fitted the front with a big 320mm single disc strong enough to match the sporting pedigree of the Thruxton with plenty of feedback to enhance your ride. Yet we've made it as unobtrusive as possible within the 1960s styling.
At the rear is another disc, so there's no compromise in the Thruxton's thoroughly modern braking performance.
The wheels are wire-spoked with aluminium alloy rims, 18 inches at the front and 17 inches rear for the classic cafe racer look. They're lightweight too, for increased suspension performance and handling agility.
Handling
We kept the geometry similar to the Bonneville's but with a little less trail at 97mm so you get sharper steering and more urgent handling when ridden hard. But the same neutral, obedient feel during less exuberant riding, making the Thruxton a rewarding as well as an easy bike to ride.

2023 Husqvarna FC 250
Elevate your personal best
Hailed as the highest performing 250 cc 4-stroke motocross machine on the market, the latest generation FC 250 receives multiple technical upgrades for 2023 to retain its place at the head of the field. Housed inside an all-new frame, a compact, lighter, redesigned engine features a revised Pankl gearbox ensuring smoother gear changes with a new quickshifter further aiding upshifts, even under heavy load. A new cylinder and CP piston increase the compression ratio to 14.5:1 for improved torque and peak performance on track. Completing the changes for 2023, striking white, yellow, and grey graphics are applied using in-mould technology for an outstanding and long-lasting finish.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
Engineered to ensure class-leading performance and handling characteristics, all major engine components and shaft arrangements are carefully positioned closer to the centre of gravity to reduce the effects of rotational inertia. Tilted two degrees backwards to further centralise mass, the 250 cc 4-stroke engine is also 60 g lighter for 2023, tipping the scales at just over 26 kg. The FC 250 engine remains remarkably powerful with an increased power output and impressive torque to suit riders of all abilities.
DOHC cylinder head
Featuring finger followers treated with a Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) coating, the DOHC cylinder head is engineered for high-level performance and further refined for 2023 with multiple revisions to improve performance and durability. The titanium intake valves remain at 32.5 mm while the exhaust valves increase in size to 27.5 mm - a direct result of the new bore/stroke ratio, which in turn optimises gas flow. These revisions allow the FC 250 to rev freely and produce strong and efficient power throughout the rev range up to its 14,000 rpm limit.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 1.8 kg. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
CNC machined triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A new, flatter seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.

Advanced Engine Control
Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) is Yamaha's exclusive ride-by-wire throttle system, derived from MotoGP technology. YCC-T works in unison with an updated Traction Control System (TCS) to give the rider responsive throttle feel with the security of traction control for roads with less than ideal traction.
Practicality Plus Performance
Touring amenities include a height-adjustable windshield, side fairing, adjustable riding position, 12V electrical outlet and a generous 4.8 gallon fuel tank. The FJ-09 is ideal for the daily commute, short fun rides, or weekend getaways.
Powerful, Controllable Brakes
Modern radial-mount four-piston front calipers squeeze 298mm rotors for exceptional stopping ability, while the anti-lock brake system (ABS) works to help prevent wheel lock during hard deceleration.
Top Shelf
A modern and stylish LED headlight offers superior visibility and complements the FJ-09's design. Multi-function dot matrix LCD instrument panel is designed to visually relay data to the rider quickly and clearly, including fuel consumption info and gear position.
Ready to Travel
Slim-design hard bags, a Genuine Yamaha Accessory, provide storage convenience, as does an accessory top case.

Comments for this 2020 Suzuki RM-Z450:
Gold bits, new plastics and graphics kit.
2020 Suzuki RM-Z450
The 2020 RM-Z450 remains the champion's choice, as its sleek, race-ready appearance, strong engine, and nimble chassis continue the Suzuki tradition of extraordinarily precise handling.
The RM-Z450 epitomizes Suzuki's Winning Balance philosophy with strong brakes for controlled stopping power, a wide spread of engine muscle with high peak power, and a strong, light, and more nimble chassis that remains the class standard for cornering performance.
Features may include:
Mount up. Because 1st place doesn't come without a fight. Razor-sharp handling. Beastly torque. Quick-response braking. They're not features, they're the difference between podium and parking lot. Our legendary RM-Zs put the track and the competition at your mercy.
Engine
The 449cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-valve, DOHC engine is the latest incarnation of Suzuki's proven and reliable fuel-injected powerplant.
The engine has high peak horsepower with strong torque at lower engine speeds for excellent throttle response through the entire rev range.
The cylinder head intake port shape creates a high amount of tumble flow to the incoming fuel/air to increase power output.
Advanced
The 2020 RM-Z450 features an evolved and efficient traction management system. The Electronic Control Module (ECM) continually measures throttle opening, engine speed, and gear position and then adjusts the ignition timing and fuel injector duration to fine-tune the engine output to deliver the best traction for the riding conditions.
The RM-Z450's traction management system is different from a street bike traction control system, as it does not measure rear tire spin. Because the needs of a motocrosser are different than a street bike, this system offers constant adjustment that maximizes traction at all times.
Transmission
The well-sorted, five-speed transmission enables precise gear shift operation. This precise transmission feel is the result of an accurately machined shift cam for exact gear selection. Specialized machining processes also increase the precision of the matching gears.
The multi-plate, wet-clutch uses rack-and-pinion clutch release mechanism for precise feel of the engagement and disengagement points while riding.
The lightweight chain guide is shaped to accurately route the drive chain smoothly.
Chassis
The RM-Z450's twin-spar frame and twin-beam swingarm design continues Suzuki's tradition of delivering the best-handling motocross machines available.
This aluminum alloy, twin-spar frame combines cast and extruded sections to achieve superior front-and-rear weight distribution while balancing strength and weight.
The frame is 700 grams (1.32 pounds) lighter than the prior generation RM-Z450 to improve cornering performance and shock absorption while delivering stable handling.
The swingarm is assembled with thin, yet strong, materials for improved cornering performance and stable handling.

2022 Honda CBR600RR
PERFORMANCE AT ITS BEST
Sportbikes especially 600-class machines are for riders who want to feel the highest degree of connection with their motorcycles. Because the greater the connection, the more rewarding the ride. And that's why we strive to make our Honda CBR600RR models as good as they are. The high-revving inline-four engine is instantly responsive. The aluminum chassis and premium suspension precisely connect you with the road like nothing else. And only a 600 can give you the light, crisp handling so many sportbike riders find so attractive. Available with optional anti-lock brakes, the CBR600RR is the best example of a highly refined breed. Is it for you? Ride one and see.
Features may include:
BRAKING
RADIAL MOUNTED FRONT-BRAKE CALIPERS
The CBR600RR uses radial-mounted monoblock front-brake calipers. This construction makes the caliper stiffer, and that means you get better brake feel for more linear, powerful stopping. Each caliper also uses four chromium-plated aluminum pistons for smooth, friction-free operation.
ENGINEERING
CENTRALLY LOCATED FUEL TANK
The CBR600RR's 4.8-gallon fuel tank is positioned in the center of the chassis and low in the frame. This allows for a more compact design, but even more important helps centralize the bike's mass. Increased mass centralization means the CBR is more responsive to rider input, especially when leaning the bike into a turn or standing it up at the exit.
HANDLING
Honda ELECTRONIC STEERING DAMPER (HESD)
Most steering dampers only sense handlebar-deflection speed. The Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) is way more sophisticated. It also detects vehicle speed, and adjusts damping proportionally. That helps maintain low-speed maneuverability while providing excellent, predictable high-speed handling.
PERFORMANCE
DUAL-STAGE FUEL INJECTION
Two sets of injectors per cylinder ensure both low- and high-rpm performance. You get near-instantaneous high-rpm response, along with great low-rpm metering and clean running.

OVERVIEW
DESCRIPTION
Low on weight and high on innovation, the TE 150 from Husqvarna Motorcycles combines high quality components, 2-stroke simplicity, and the latest technical innovations. The result is an exceptional enduro machine capable of mastering the toughest terrain. Incredibly agile thanks to its expertly crafted frame and advanced WP suspension, the TE 150 makes riders from beginner through to professional feel in total control and able to ride freely and to the very best of their ability. Highlighting Husqvarna Motorcycles' continued development of the enduro range, the Swedish-inspired dark blue and electric yellow graphics, together with a metallic blue frame, create a distinctive look.
ULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT PUNCH
Engine: The TE 150 has inherited the same fuel-injected technology from the bigger TE 250 and 300. This adds the convenience of a 4-stroke engine by eliminating the need to premix fuel or adjust jetting for altitude. The engine also uses specific shaft arrangements, which are designed to harness the rotating mass of the engine for nimble handling. This, among other developments, makes it a lightweight and compact engine providing usable enduro-specific power while maintaining the low-cost maintenance of a 2-stroke.
Cylinder And Piston: The TE 150 features a cylinder with a 58 mm bore and an innovative power valve design. This allows the lively 150 cc engine to deliver controllable power throughout the RPM range. The piston is designed to perfectly match the contour of the combustion chamber, delivering the highest level of 2-stroke performance. Additionally, the cylinder features injectors mounted at the inlet positions, which deliver the fuel downwards into the transfer port, guaranteeing excellent fuel atomization. This ensures more efficient fuel combustion, reduced fuel consumption and improved emissions.
Crankcase: Designed for minimal weight, the crankcases on the TE 150 engine feature a thin-wall design. To centralize mass, the shaft arrangements are precisely positioned to harness rotating masses at the ideal center of gravity, while improved sealing is taken care of by the reed block which features optimized carbon fiber reed petals.
Exhaust: Tailored specifically for each model using an innovative 3D design process, the header pipe on the TE 150 offers an advanced geometry and performance. This allows for improved ground clearance, making the header pipe resistant to impact out on the trail. The muffler also features an aluminium mounting bracket and advanced internal construction for excellent noise damping and weight saving.
STATE OF THE ART CHASSIS
Frame: The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium grey powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
Composite Carbon Fibre Subframe: The carbon composite subframe is unique to Husqvarna Motorcycles and showcases advanced production technology and innovation. Using 70% polyamide and 30% carbon fibre, the 2-piece subframe has a total weight of just over 2.2 lb. With the help of computational dynamics, specific rigidity was engineered into the light and robust subframe, delivering outstanding handling and rider comfort.
Oil Tank And Pump: An electronic oil pump feeds vital 2-stroke oil into the engine. It is located just below the oil tank and feeds the oil via the throttle body, meaning the oil is only mixed with air at this stage. The pump is controlled by the EMS and delivers the optimal amount of oil according to the current RPM and engine load. The oil tank is connected to a filler hose which runs through the upper tube of the frame to a filler cap conveniently located for easy refills. The tank capacity is 0.7 l and is connected to a low-level sensor which illuminates when the tank needs refilling.
Integrated Cooling And Radiators: The radiators are expertly crafted using high-strength aluminium with CFD (computational fluid dynamics) to channel air through the radiators more efficiently. The cooling system is intelligently integrated into the frame, eliminating the need for additional hoses. The large centre tube running through the frame reduces pressure at this point, allowing for a consistent coolant flow. Additionally, the radiators are mounted close to the centre of gravity for improved handling agility. An optional radiator fan can be fitted and is available in the Husqvarna accessories catalogue.
NIMBLE HANDLING
WP XPLOR Front Fork: The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for off-road riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping is in the left leg and rebound damping is in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
WP XACT Rear Shock: The WP XACT shock provides advanced damping characteristics to the range. New valve seals with reduced hardness offer improved shock feedback. The compact and lightweight shock features a pressure balance inside, ensuring consistent damping and superior rider comfort. Using the same linkage progression found in the Husqvarna Motocross range, the rear end sits low for improved control in extreme enduro conditions. The fully adjustable component delivers 300 mm rear wheel travel, as well as unrivalled traction, feeling and energy absorption.
Hydraulic Brakes: The highest level of quality is guaranteed with the new BRAKTEC braking system, offering the highest level of braking performance while being specifically tailored for enduro riding and delivering a sensitive and modulated feel. GSK wave disks (260 mm disc front and 220 mm rear) complete the high-quality braking package for complete confidence.
Hydraulic Clutch: The new high quality BRAKTEC clutch system guarantees even wear, reliable and near maintenance-free operation as well as perfect modulation in every condition. Meaning that play is constantly compensated so that the pressure point and function of the clutch remain identical in cold or hot conditions, as well as over time.
Bodywork: The TE 150 features a bodywork which clearly showcases Husqvarna Motorcycles' progressive approach to offroad motorcycles while the Swedish inspired dark blue and electric yellow graphics create a distinctive look. The ergonomics are specifically tailored to deliver great comfort and control. As a result of extensive testing, the slim contact points make shifting between riding positions easier and allow the rider to flow with movement. The flat seat profile, together with the seat cover texture, deliver superior comfort and control in all conditions.
Wheels And Tyres: Black high-strength alloy rims by D.I.D are coupled to CNC machined hubs using lightweight spokes and silver anodised aluminium nipples. Fitted to the wheels are Dunlop tires which offer superior grip on a wide variety of terrain. New for 2023, a Dunlop MX33 is mounted on the front and is paired with a Dunlop AT81 on the rear.
CNC Machined Triple Clamp: The 22 mm offset black-anodized CNC machined triple clamps offer premium quality and style standard on all Husqvarna enduro models. The triple clamps have been expertly crafted using superior techniques and materials to provide high levels of quality and reliability. A 2-way handlebar adjustment is standard and allows for customisable ergonomics.
PREMIUM TECHNOLOGY
MAP Switch: By using the MAP SELECT SWITCH, the engine characteristics can be tailored to modify the power delivery according to rider preference, conditions and terrain. It has two settings which can be toggled on the fly, namely, Map 1, for standard and full power, and Map 2, for softer power and delayed ignition timing for terrain with less traction.
Throttle Body: The TE 150 uses a 39 mm throttle body which regulates the amount of air entering the engine via a butterfly operated by dual throttle cables connected to a handlebar throttle assembly. 2-stroke oil is mixed with the air and enters the engine to lubricate the crankshaft, cylinder and piston. Additionally, a throttle position sensor (TPS) relays airflow data to the ECU which in turn calculates the amount of oil and fuel delivered to the engine while a bypass screw regulates the idling speed and a cold start device opens a bypass providing more air for cold starts.
Electric Start And Wiring Harness: All TE models come standard with an electric starter. The system uses a compact and lightweight Li-Ion battery which is 2.2 lb lighter than a conventional battery. With several years of experience of developing and perfecting electric starting, the proven reliability on the Husqvarna enduro range is second to none, ensuring a quick and seamless start in any condition. Additionally, the wiring harness concentrates all needed electrical components into a common area below the seat for easy accessibility.
Engine Management System: The TE 150 features an electronic control unit (ECU) which is responsible for a number of functions. The unit determines the ignition timing, the amount of fuel and oil injected into the cylinder and additionally, translates the information received from various sensors to adapt values and make corrections for automatic temperature and altitude compensation. This means the engine always runs at the optimum fuel/air mixture at any altitude.

2022 KTM 500 XCF-W
HARD-HITTING ACCURACY
Think of the 2022 KTM 500 XCF-W as a sledgehammer. Hard-hitting, effective, and utterly devastating. But, thanks to a nimble chassis and its even more compact high-tech engine, this large-displacement power machine is surprisingly light and rideable. As a result, this 510 cc SOHC single-cylinder powerhouse has an incredible power-to-weight ratio and provides nothing less than the most dynamic, and exciting offroad experience available.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Combining compact dimensions with immense power output, this 510 cc fuel-injected SOHC powerplant is the most powerful and refined on the market. Its class-leading power delivery is available throughout the entire rev range and with its low weight of only 29.2 kilograms, is also the lightest half-liter engine out there.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM XCF-W models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 2 lbs, providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XCF-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Decals
Drawing inspiration from the RED BULL KTM FACTORY RACING TEAM, the 2022 KTM XCF-W range features a bold contrast of orange and blue tones, as well as a factory-inspired blue seat. These are applied using in-mold graphics, which feature greater friction and fade resistance, meaning your steed will look factory-fresh after even the toughest time spend on the trails.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Battery & wiring harness
No one wants to kickstart a 510 cc behemoth. For that reason, the KTM 500 XCF-W is fitted with a time-proven electrical system, powered by a super lightweight 2 Ah lithium-ion starter battery. The wiring harness also has most of the electrical components carefully positioned into a common area below the seat, making them easily accessible.

2022 Honda Shadow Aero
OLD SCHOOL COOL
Comfort on a motorcycle is about way more than just how thick the seat is or where the footpegs are. Because comfort is more than how you feel on the bike it's how the bike makes you feel. And that's why we build the Shadow Aero and Shadow Aero ABS two bikes that just feel right, so you'll feel the same way riding them. The V-twin engine is a natural choice, narrow and offering plenty of torque. The chromed dual exhaust makes this bike sound great too. A low seat height, low center of gravity, low-maintenance shaft drive and classic looks round out the package. Want one with our anti-lock brake system as well? Then just check out the Shadow Aero ABS, which also adds a rear disc brake.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
V-TWIN ENGINE
Nothing pumps out the torque like a big V-twin. The Aero's power makes it perfect for around-town cruising, commutes and casual weekend-long rides.
STYLE
2-INTO-2 EXHAUST SYSTEM
Sleek pipes feature bullet-style mufflers for that classic cruiser style of yesteryear. Large-diameter head pipes and the 2-into-2 system design combine to put out true, V-twin cruiser sound.
CHROME HIGHLIGHTS
Chrome highlights include cylinder-head covers, air-cleaner cover, engine sidecovers, brake and clutch-lever brackets, rear brake pedal, shift lever, handlebar, rear shock covers and more.
COMFORT
COMFORTABLE SADDLE
Broad, low-slung solo seat features a detachable passenger seat.
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
Skimming the pavement at just 25.9 inches, the Aero's low seat height makes flat-footing it at stoplights or in parking lots a breeze. And the Aero's narrow seat/tank junction makes it feel even lower.
DRIVETRAIN
FIVE-SPEED TRANSMISSION
Wide-ratio five-speed transmission lets you cruise the boulevard at a low, unhurried pace, yet allows you to hop on the highway without revving the engine through the roof.
PROGRAMMED FUEL INJECTION (PGM-FI)
Forget about fiddling with a choke the Shadow's fuel injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes, and optimal performance in any condition.
ENGINEERING
FRONT-DISC BRAKE
If there's one place you don't want retro performance, it's your brakes. That's why we gave the Shadow Aero a 296mm front disc for distinctly modern stopping power. Additionally, our ABS model comes with Honda's Anti-Lock Brake System.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 KTM 500 EXC-F Six Days
Considered the hardest-hitting missile in the KTM dual-sport arsenal, the KTM 500 EXC-F SIX DAYS represents everything we love about big single-cylinder 4-strokes - torque, acceleration, and uncontestable power. Wrapped in all-new France Six Days Enduro (ISDE) edition colors, and featuring an extended list of top-of-the-line components, the KTM 500 EXC-F SIX DAYS brings the firepower.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Combining compact dimensions with immense power output, this 510 cc fuel-injected SOHC powerplant is the most powerful and refined on the market. Its class-leading power delivery is available throughout the entire rev range and with its low weight of only 29.2 kilograms (64.3 lbs), is also the lightest half-liter engine out there.
Cylinder Head
The KTM 500 EXC-F SIX DAYS engine is fitted with a compact SOHC cylinder head for optimal mass centralization. The head configuration promises efficient power delivery and unrivaled performance. A single overhead camshaft also ensures optimal gas flow, with low-friction rocker arms and timing chain guides guarantee consistent performance throughout the rpm range.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM SIX DAY models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed - not to mention FACTORY RACING style thanks to the striking orange coating. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 2 pounds and providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
Swingarm
The KTM 500 EXC-F SIX DAYS features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exceptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM SIX DAYS models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars, that can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
Seat
It goes without saying that six days spent in the saddle require a certain level of comfort. For that reason, the KTM 500 EXC-F SIX DAYS features a softer, grippier seat, finished in a blue and red color combination.

A coned disc-spring hydraulic clutch offers a direct feel, light lever action, and consistent performance.
KX CHASSIS PERFORMANCE

Light and nimble handling is achieved thanks to the lean, lightweight chassis of the legendary KX450 motocross bike. A well-balanced aluminum perimeter frame helps keep the overall weight down and allows for slim ergonomics. The high-performance, race-ready suspension has been optimized for cross-country racing, especially on aggressive trails. Large-diameter brakes deliver strong stopping power, offering a high level of control.
CROSS-COUNTRY CAPABILITY

This bike is a perfect run around town, take a nice solo ride or maybe even a day trip kind of bike. With a 2 into 1 exhaust and screaming eagle intake this bike roars down the road. The custom HD seat puts you in the ideal riding position to stay comfortable on your cruise. The bobber conversion was done in house, exposing that massive rear tire and leaving none of it to the imagination. Retains the stock style lighting and license plate as well. In addition to that we have also fitted this motorcycle with a Touratech light bar wired to the brights for those real dark back country rides. To tie it all up the bike also features a custom wrap.

2023 Husqvarna FX 350
Ride the smarter line
With the agility of a 250 and a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, the FX 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, as a user-friendly riding experience is guaranteed in all conditions. With considered revisions to the engine and chassis for 2023, together with advanced electronics to further enhance performance, the FX 350 is a highly capable off-road machine. Complete with a new, Swedish-inspired white, yellow, and grey colour scheme, which is applied to redesigned bodywork, the striking aesthetics, improved ergonomics, and flatter seat profile clearly indicates the continued development of the FX 350.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new FX 350 engine is designed to deliver maximum performance. For 2023, the repositioning of all major engine components and shaft arrangements enhances overall handling with the design improving anti-squat behaviour from the whole chassis. The engine is tilted two degrees backwards and is 8 mm shorter in height to further centralise mass. Weighing just 59.9 lb, the new 350cc 4-stroke engine produces a higher and more usable power output.
Cylinder head
Fully redesigned for 2023, the DOHC cylinder head offers improved durability and serviceability, with Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers to guarantee minimal friction and optimal performance. These actuate large titanium valves, 36.3 mm for the intake and 29.1 mm for the exhaust, which optimise gas flow for strong, usable power across the rev-range, all the way up to the 13,400 rpm limit. Revised valve timings work in perfect harmony with the redesigned camshaft which now features a new bearing bridge designed to increase stiffness and improve serviceability.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 3.9 lb. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
Triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.

This beautiful cherry red 2008 Honda CBR 1000RR is in fantastic condition, has newer tires, and is an absolute beast. This is a perfect choice for street or track day rider looking for a full powered, 175hp super bike.

The CBR 1000RR needs no introduction. It is Honda's flagship 1000cc super bike. Marketed in Europe as the Honda Fireblade, the CBR 1000RR uses an inline four cylider motor that produces 175 horsepower. And while this bike is a relentless powerhouse in the higher rev range, it is a docile, easy to ride motorcycle for use on the street and highway in the low and midrange rpms. Body positioning is relatively comfortable by sport bike standards, and the smooth power delivery makes for a confidence inspiring ride.

This specific example has a newer set of Michelin Pilot Power 5 2CT tires. It is almost entirely in stock condition, with the exception of a license plate tidy kit which cleans up the rear end of the bike nicely.

This is a fantastic deal for a lightly used Honda Superbike, don't wait reserve it today!

Suzuki SV650,https://seattle.craigslist.org/sno/mcy/d/bothell-suzuki-sv650/7576884598.html,7576884598,"$6,500","FOR SALE: 2006 Suzuki SV650 Naked – Candy Napoleon Blue (Color Code – ‘YHJ’)

After many years of enjoyment, I am finally selling my 2006 Suzuki SV650 Naked with 16,600 miles that was purchased in 2010. I am the second owner and this highly sought-after bike was always garage kept and ridden. It was rarely ever caught in inclement weather. As a two-cylinder motor, this bike has great low end torque and gets excellent miles per gallon (mpg) and achieves anywhere between 45 and 55 mpg.

Additional Information: While I am meticulous in caring for my bike, I have participated in two track days – one @ Pacific Raceways & one @ The Ridge Motorsports Park. This bike was never laid down or dropped. I consider this bike in immaculate condition with exception to a few minor wear and tear paint discrepancies on the tank, front fender & tail. Recent coolant change, coolant hoses & thermostat, regular oil changes, recent chain adjustment & clean/lube service, and new Dunlop GPR-300 tires installed on 9/2/22. Date codes on the tires are: 0922 front, 1022 rear. The extensive and tasteful modifications list totals $3925 for everything you see listed below.

Modifications List ($3925 – Receipts Available):

Rizoma Front Turn Signals
Rizoma Frame Sliders
Rizoma Front & Rear Brake Fluid Reservoirs
Rizoma Swing Arm Spools

This rare find is available for $6,500 or best reasonable offer. My SV650 is not stock, but certainly looks the way it should’ve come from the factory. If you are looking for an immaculate SV650 that was well maintained, cleanly modified and pampered for the past 12 years, this may be the bike for you. I do not need to sell this bike nor am I pressed to sell. I am choosing to sell this this bike to make room for new projects and I would love for this bike to go to a good home. Private showing available by appointment only.

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE.

Thank you for your interest in advance.",excellent,gas,16600,manual,sport bike,blue,clean,650,,yes,JS1VP53A062106717,,,

NEW STREET TRIPLE R
Like the Street Triple, but harder.
It's a tough looking, higher spec version of the Street Triple - not an easy task when the original is so impressive. A real challenge, but we've taken this bike to a new level of style and performance. Introducing the Street Triple R.
Fitted with fully adjustable front and rear suspension, Nissin 4-piston radial front calipers and radial master cylinder, parts normally found in the supersports category.
The upside down forks are anodized black to compliment an aggressive new Matt Graphite paint scheme with distinctive orange ""R"" graphics and two-tone black and grey stitched seat. With Magura tapered aluminum handlebars, it's not a bike for those who do subtle, more for those who take things to the max.

While you wait for only 1 hour for a full charge you can think about the 124mph top speed you can hit, the 140 ft/lb of torque you’ll send the the rear wheel and the 187 miles you can ride before having to recharge.

2023 KTM 350 SX-F

With over a decade of racing - and winning - at the highest tier of professional motocross, the KTM 350 SX-F has long shed its underdog label and proven itself a worthy adversary. Delivering usable power throughout the rev range, unwavering stability at speed, and true championship-winning credentials, the 2023 KTM 350 SX-F is once again READY TO RACE.
Features may include:
Easy suspension adjustment
Get dialed in! The 2023 KTM SX range boasts totally tool-free suspension setup at both ends. Thanks to an all-new shock absorber design featuring hand-adjustable dual compression control, it allows riders to adjust high- and low-speed settings in a matter of seconds. On the front end, the forks are also easily adjusted thanks to a single air pressure preload valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. We'll even throw the air pump in as standard.
More Usable Power
Perfectly filling the gap with the KTM 250 SX-F and the powerhouse KTM 450 SX-F, the lightweight KTM 350 SX-F powerplant weighs in at only 60.6 lb. This makes it the ultimate weapon when weighing up power to weight options.
Ergonomics
The 2023 KTM SX and SX-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high grip seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. The polyamide reinforced aluminum subframe further enhances rider feel and feedback.
Mass Centralization
Ready to rip your arms out of the sockets? Together with the benefits of mass centralization and an overall lighter feel, the anti-squat behavior of the chassis is significantly improved by changing the backbone of the steel frame concept. In layman's terms, the 2023 KTM 350 SX-F gets its power down perfectly when tearing out of corners.
Energy Absorption
Besides the expertly crafted, hydro-formed, laser-cut, and robot-welded frame being engineered to provide exceptional rider feedback and straight-line stability, it consists of specifically calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex. This means the frame acts as a shock absorber of sorts, making for a less harsh ride, resulting in less rider fatigue over many hard laps.

Large petrol tank restored, rechromed and painted, new seat, new fenders and stays, tachometer and speedometer rebuilt, new cables and chains, 12 volt negative ground electronic regulator and belt drive generator conversion, vintage English Dunlop alloy wheels with new stainless spokes, frame finished in durable gloss black powder coat.
The engine is rebuilt with reground crankshaft with new sludge tube, connecting rods re-sized, valves and guides replaced, -357 camshaft, all new bearings and the timing side crank bushing replaced with a steel-backed item, line bored to spec and balanced for smooth running. New Amal carburetor. New fork tubes and bushings. Gearbox has new bearings and a 4 spring Triumph style clutch. Rebuilt magneto.


The bike started life as a Rocket Gold star, likely as USA west coast finish, as shown by the frame number. The engine is not original to this bike, but being an older bike restored from a basket case, this is not unusual these days. The engine is a BSA Super Rocket engine, quite similar to the one the bike would have had from the factory, only a little earlier off the production line with a lower serial number. I restored this bike for my own use and I have put just over 200 miles on it. It starts easily and runs smoothly at speed and goes 80 MPH quite happily.

2020 Yamaha YZ450F
TUNE IN TO VICTORY
Class leading performance and suspension along with the smartphone power tuner app make this the bike of choice for race winners.
Features may include:ENGINE
New More Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder
The YZ450F's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design is now even lighter and more compact than before, ideally positioned in the frame for optimized weight distribution. Inside, the new head features steeper valve angles to allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port, as well as more aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint working together with a higher compression bridge-box design piston, DLC-coated piston pin, and longer connecting rod to give YZ450F riders the best balance of class leading power with an all new level of controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing track and weather conditions.
Electric Starter System
The YZ450F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Revised Bilateral Beam Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact aluminum frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Every aspect has been carefully retuned, with thinner main spar construction, thicker down tubes, revised top triple clamp, and all-new motor mounts that work together to optimize overall rigidity balance for excellent handling, especially in fast, bumpy conditions.
Compact Body and New Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. The new handlebar position is 5mm lower and 15mm forward and the seat features 10% firmer foam to assist the rider in keeping their weight forward during aggressive riding.
New Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The new top triple clamp design is resculpted to balance rigidity for improved steering feel, while the 4-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

Inside, the new head features steeper valve angles to allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port, as well as more aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint working together with a higher compression bridge-box design piston, DLC-coated piston pin, and longer connecting rod to give YZ450F riders the best balance of class leading power with an all new level of controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing track and weather conditions.
Electric Starter System
The YZ450F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Revised Bilateral Beam Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact aluminum frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Every aspect has been carefully retuned, with thinner main spar construction, thicker down tubes, revised top triple clamp, and all-new motor mounts that work together to optimize overall rigidity balance for excellent handling, especially in fast, bumpy conditions.
Compact Body and New Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. The new handlebar position is 5mm lower and 15mm forward and the seat features 10% firmer foam to assist the rider in keeping their weight forward during aggressive riding.
New Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The new top triple clamp design is resculpted to balance rigidity for improved steering feel, while the 4-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

2022 Honda CRF250R
POWER WHERE YOU WANT IT
Horsepower is horsepower, right? Anybody who's ever raced knows it's a lot more complicated. Where your bike makes its power is at least as important as how much power it puts out. And that's where our 2022 Honda CRF250R is a real game changer. Because we've made some big improvements to this bike's engine, giving it way more power and torque in the midrange. And that means it's easier to ride fast, because the midrange is key in critical track sections like whoops, managing jumps, or blasting out of deep loam and berms. And to handle all that extra torque, we've also given it a new nine-plate clutch. Finally, there's the new single-pipe exhaust, a big contributor to the CRF250R's lighter overall weight. Plus, the pipe's design helps slim the bodywork so it's even easier for you to move around.
Features may include:ENGINEERING
NINE-PLATE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY
Say good-bye to clutch fade the bike uses a nine-plate design to improve durability and hookup. That means less slip at peak horsepower, better torque transmission through the clutch pack and greater durability. Plus, the clutch pull is lighter, and you get improved engagement feel.
BIG BORE/SHORT STROKE
The CRF250R's 79.0mm bore and short 50.9mm stroke let our engineers create a high-revving engine with plenty of room for large valves. The engine breathes and revs the two keys to making power in the motocross world.TECHNOLOGY
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF250R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
The CRF250R is equipped with an effortless electric starter. Convenient and lightweight, it's a huge deal if you need to restart a stalled bike in the heat of battle.PERFORMANCE
MORE MIDRANGE TORQUE AND POWER
The key to riding a 250 fast is to keep it in the powerband. The 2022 CRF250R features a new cam, new valve timing, and a new press-fit cam sprocket along with new ignition timing. Together they boost the critical midrange torque and power significantly, giving you the advantage you need.
FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM
By installing the CRF250R's fuel injector at a 60-degree angle, the injector sprays fuel all the way back to the throttle butterfly. The engine gets a cooler, denser fuel charge for more power and better torque. It's little details like this that put the CRF250R up front.HANDLING
REVISED FRAME RIGIDITY
Great handling starts with a superior frame, and that's one place where the CRF250R's chassis puts you out front. First, it's light over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation's. By making the frame's main spars narrow, we save weight, but more important we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.
SHOWA SPRING FORK
The 49mm Showa fork features a conventional spring design that helps increase the CRF250R's front-suspension precision, handling and feel. The fork's 39mm piston diameter and 25mm rod diameter are designed to provide a plush feel and supple action.COMFORT
BLACK RIMS
They may not help you go faster, but the sweet black DID DirtStar rims sure look good.

2023 Kawasaki KLX300SM
GET OUT AND PLAY
The KLX300SM ultimate lightweight supermoto motorcycle takes the fun to the streets in full supermoto style. A quick-accelerating engine, paired with light, agile handling, evokes the playfulness within. Suspension, wheels, and brakes are optimized for supermoto, and the overall aggressive styling means business. The KLX300SM is quick to steal the scene with equal parts performance and attitude.
Features may include:
POWER AND PERFORMANCE
DELIVER THE EXCITEMENT
The KLX300SM ultimate lightweight supermoto motorcycle is powered by a 292cc, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled engine. Experience a rewarding spread of power across the rev range. Smooth power delivery and crisp throttle response helps riders of all skill levels maneuver through stop-and-go city traffic, navigate country back roads, or experience the exhilaration of supermoto racing at their local track. Electric start offers easy starting; fuel injection helps with reliable starting in a wide range of conditions and contributes to improved fuel economy.
SUPERMOTO-TUNED PERFORMANCE
TAKE THE FUN TO THE STREETS
The KLX300SM motorcycle is built with a slim, lightweight perimeter frame that's maneuverable but rigid at higher speeds to help with straight-line stability. With the smaller front wheel, the caster angle (25°) and short wheelbase contribute to quick handling. Suspension performance offers 9.1 inches of travel up front and 8.1 inches in the rear, ideal for supermoto riding. The 43mm inverted cartridge-style front fork has adjustable compression damping to optimize fork performance for conditions and personal preference. The Uni-Trak rear suspension offers bump absorption and rebound damping adjustability, and fully adjustable preload, allowing riders to tailor shock settings to personal preference. Substantial braking power comes thanks to a large 300mm semi-floating petal disc and twin-piston caliper up front and a 240mm petal rear disc and single-piston caliper. Agile supermoto performance is further enabled with 17-inch wheels and road tires contributing to better handling on the street.
COMFORTABLE ERGONOMICS
MAKE COMFORT A PRIORITY
An upright and relaxed riding position makes it comfortable to ride the KLX300SM motorcycle. Rider-friendly ergonomics are complemented by a thick-padded seat, rubber dampened footpegs, and a 33.9-inch seat height that allows riders to comfortably reach the ground at stops which increases confidence. The innovative radiator fan directs hot air down and away from the rider and from high touch areas for added comfort in traffic.
SUPERMOTO STYLE
ALL ATTITUDE. NO APOLOGIES.
The aggressive supermoto-inspired bodywork on the race-inspired KLX300SM motorcycle delivers performance and attitude. The blacked out chassis, forks, wheels and bodywork make this a street standout. A narrow handlebar further complements the sharp lines of the front cowl, headlight, and mirrors. From the cockpit, all-digital instrumentation is on display, including a digital speedometer, bar-type tachometer, clock, odometer, dual trip meters, and a range of warning/indicator lamps.

2005 Triumph Tiger 955i - Stunner!,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcy/d/seattle-2005-triumph-tiger-955i-stunner/7575987448.html,7575987448,"$3,777","Sadly for sale is my beloved ‘05 Tiger. This bike took me on a winding cross-country adventure from Denver to Seattle, and on several trips since. Always been ridden responsibly and never been down. I have taken care of it like my baby and it shows. The bike needs nothing, and has $1600+ invested in the last 4 years.

Upgrades:
Delkevic carbon fiber exhaust (sounds glorious on the triple)
Heed crash bars
Heated grips
Rizoma LED front signals
MRA adjustable windscreen
Touratech hand guards
Tiger stripe decal delete
Tank professionally repainted

As you can tell, everything on this bike is the highest quality. One small defect to mention: the paint on the tank is bubbling in a couple spots. I had it repainted partly to fix the original bubbling paint, and also to get rid of the heinous factory tiger stripe decals. It makes this bike unique, and MUCH more attractive than just about every other one out there. The bubbling is a notorious issue on these bikes, and unfortunately the new paint is bubbling again. It’s pretty minor, but if you’re a bit OCD like me you’ll notice it. All in all, for an 18 year old bike she’s in great shape.

Happy to answer any questions. Price is not set in stone, but this is a beautiful bike that I’m not in a hurry to sell, so I won’t entertain offers before you look at it. Test drives with moto endorsement and cash in my hand.

Asking $3750

Thanks for looking!

NO SET UP FEE!!!
2023 Honda CRF125F
MIDSIZED ENGINE. SUPERSIZED FUN.
There's no one-size-fits-all solution for dirt bikes, but the Honda CRF125F gets pretty darn close. Sized right for young riders and smaller adults, it's full of features that help you focus on the best parts of the experience. First of all, it offers the kind of legendary reliability that's made Honda famous, so you know it will be part of your riding stable for years to come. Fuel injection eliminates carburetor woes, and is one reason behind the bike's easy-to-use power. The four-speed transmission and conventional clutch provides the control of a full-sized bike. Long-travel suspension delivers a comfortable ride. And a graphics package right off our factory MX bikes pumps up the pride factor too. For taller riders who want the same awesome features and powerband, check out the CRF125F Big Wheel. It's the same great idea, but with a taller seat height.
Features may include:
RELIABLE ENGINE
The CRF125F's dependable four-stroke, single-cylinder engine offers good performance with a wide powerband perfect for a range of riders, including beginners. Fuel injection makes it even better and more efficient.
PRO-LINK REAR SUSPENSION
Progressive linkage connects a single heavy-duty shock to the swingarm, delivering an excellent combination of spring and damping rates over a wide range of riding conditions.
PROVEN MANUAL CLUTCH
The heavy-duty Honda clutch is durable and helps promote smooth shifting.
STEEL FRAME AND SWINGARM
Less experienced riders are hard on equipment, especially when they're just starting out. That's why we gave the CRF125F a strong, twin-spar-type steel frame and swingarm that are built to handle the bumps and dings of off-road riding.
FOUR-SPEED TRANSMISSION
The four-speed gearbox is just like a full-sized motorcycle's, giving you all the control you need.

2023 KTM 250 XC
For decades, the 250 cc 2-stroke cross country class has been at the forefront of pure unadulterated performance. It is epitomized by sweet-smelling 2-Stroke smoke, top-end powerbands and rocketship-like acceleration. The 2023 KTM 250 XC takes that to an all-new level, thanks to a container-load of cutting-edge advancements across the board. For 2023, this 2-Stoke legend has stepped up, and even further out of reach of the competition.
Features may include:
Engine
The KTM 250 XC has always represented the very best of unsurpassed power and lightweight construction. The simplicity and low maintenance cost of the 2-Stroke motor have made it a favorite amongst hard-core cross country racers for generations. For 2023, The KTM 250 XC enters the pits with increased performance and an overall engine weight of only 52.6 lb - with a number of ground-up engine ehancements to ensure the KTM 250 XC engine maintains its benchmark as the one to beat.
Wheels and Tyres
These don't only look the part - they play it too! High-strength, lightweight black alloy rims by GIANT are coupled to CNC machined hubs using lightweight spokes and silver anodised aluminium nipples. The spoke nipples incorporate a revised design reducing the frequency of spoke checks and maintenance. A Dunlop GEOMAX MX-33F takes care of business at the front, with a GEOMAX AT81 completing the package.

Neken Handlebar
All KTM XC and XC-F models are equipped with a tapered handlebar made of high-strength aluminum by NEKEN. The proprietary KTM bend delivers optimal control and unintended rider impacts are absorbed by the newly designed KTM branded bar pad, which features the same design patterns as seen on the frame protectors and tank spoilers - now that's a touch of class.
Fuel tank

A new 2.24 gallon polythene fuel tank incorporates a threaded filler cap and an integrated fuel pump. The fuel pump features an external fuel line which is specifically positioned to make it less exposed and susceptible to damage, while ensuring a steady, uninterrupted flow of fuel.
Map Select Switch
The 2023 KTM 250 XC features a map select switch as standard, allowing the racer to switch between 2 perceptible engine maps. Map 1 provides a linear, predictable power delivery, while Map 2 gives it the full beans with crisp, explosive power output.

Features & Benefits
New For 2008
Computer-controlled fuel injection monitors multiple engine parameters to calculate perfect mixture under nearly all conditions.
Engine
102-cubic-inch (1670cc) air-cooled, pushrod OHV 48-degree V-twin pumps out huge amounts of torque barely off idle for brisk acceleration and fantastic overall cruising performance.
Hydraulic valve lifters driven by twin camshafts deliver exceptional performance and less maintenance. Ceramic composite cylinder bore plating ensures greater durability and optimal heat dissipation.
Smooth-shifting five-speed transmission with 5th-gear overdrive delivers outstanding cruising performance with low rpm at highway speeds.
Dry sump lubrication system uses a handy spin-on filter and creates lower center of gravity by helping keep overall engine height to a minimum.
Electric starting system features solenoid-activated auto-decompressor for easy, dependable starting.
Chassis/Suspension
Solid-mounted engine housed in specially designed rigid-look, double-cradle frame features a stylish 32-degree rake.
Extra-long 66.5-inch wheelbase creates long and low retro profile, added rider comfort and well-balanced handling.

Description
IRON 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look. Now with fresh, new graphics.
TEAR UP THE NEAREST STREETS WITH RAW CUSTOM STYLE
Blacked-Out Look
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Tuck and Roll Seat
A solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

2022 GASGAS MC 125,https://seattle.craigslist.org/tac/mcd/d/lakewood-2022-gasgas-mc-125/7575865501.html,7575865501,"$6,799","2022 GASGAS MC 125 - () STOCK #:
Available at: South Bound Motorsports Lakewood ☎ Phone: (253) 387-7310
Lets face it, BRAPPPITY BRAAPPP just doesn't jingle everyones bells. Some of us live for that two stroke life, RINGDINGDING!!! This MC 125 is about as close to new as you can get, so you can tell that salesman to toss the freight and setup fees bud, they're smoked . Basically brand new (maybe one ride?) Dunlop MX33's, no frame or case wear and properly cared for by a well respected family in the Moto industry this bike is ready to rip. What can we say, its a 125 two smoker! Come on down, let us help you into that two stroke life.
2022 GASGAS MC 125
It's hard to beat the pure joy of a screaming 125cc 2-stroke! The perfect bike on which to develop lifelong motocross skills, our MC 125 matches a competitive 125cc, 6-speed motor with a super agile and responsive chassis and suspension set-up to deliver fun, fun, fun.
Features may include:
BODYWORK
Red with a splash of white. That's the way we like it! The bodywork fitted to all GASGAS motocross bikes not only reflects our vibrant, Spanish personality but also ensures complete harmony between rider and bike. Considered ergonomics allow unrestricted movement while our flat, high-grip seat profile delivers comfort and control in all conditions.
AIRBOX
Less time working on bikes means more time riding bikes, which is exactly why you'll love the straightforward, no tools needed filter mounting system on all GASGAS motocross bikes. Allowing quick and easy filter changes, the airbox is designed with precisely positioned inlet ducts that ensure maximum airflow and protection of the Twin Air filter.
FRAME
The technology in our frames ensures riders enjoy playful handling and an energetic feeling on any motocross tracks. Underneath the red powder coating there's a lightweight chromium molybdenum steel, hydro-formed, laser-cut and robot-welded chassis that's built to perform. Designed to be rigid where it needs to be rigid and to flex where flex is needed, it provides exceptional rider feedback, energy absorption and straight-line stability.
SUBFRAME
With a short and compact profile all GASGAS motocross subframes are made from lightweight aluminum. The profile helps centralize mass while also keeping weight down.
MOTOR
The heart of our MC 125 is a compact, 40hp, 17.2kg, 125cc 2-stroke motor. Delivering lots of torque, our power unit makes the bike super easy to use but also highly competitive - perfect for both beginners and top-flight racers. Designed to centralize all internal moving parts, the motor also plays a huge role in the bike's agile handling.
CYLINDER & PISTON
Hidden away inside our MC 125 cylinder is an innovative power valve system. Responsible for controlling both the main and lateral exhaust ports (we said it was innovative!) when combined with the two-part cylinder head it does its thing to make sure the motor delivers seriously impressive power, allowing riders to benefit from free-revving power.
BRAKES
Fast is fun but slowing down is essential, which is why all GASGAS motocross bikes are fitted with Brembo calipers and controls. With 260mm front and 220mm (solid) rear disks, braking is easy, inspiring riders to push harder and ride faster.
BREMBO HYDRAULIC CLUTCH
No need for adjustment and a near maintenance-free operation, but the best thing about the Brembo hydraulic clutch is that it delivers a perfectly smooth action time and time again. With lever free-play automatically adjusted, the biting point and function of the clutch remain constant no matter if it's hot or cold.

2021 Zero SR/S Premium
Features may include:
SR/S TECHNOLOGY
Inspired by cutting edge aerospace design, the new look of the SR/S is rooted in its all-new aerodynamic fairing. Like all things Zero Motorcycles, form follows function. When you lean into the cockpit and get behind the fairing you will be rewarded with a 13% improvement in highway efficiency and range with the SR/S versus its award-winning sibling, the SR/F. Sit up and you’ll discover a more upright and relaxed riding position that feels as good as it looks.
Elevated Design. The full-fairing on the new SR/S gives it a premium look that commands attention from the passing to the parking lot. Wrapped tight across the bike’s trellis frame, it envelops a forward leaning rider in its cockpit for maximum aerodynamic efficiency and increases overall range by 13% over the naked SR/F.
Premium Comfort. Thanks to lower foot position and higher handlebar height, riders will enjoy a more upright and relaxed riding position on the new SR/S. Its ergonomic comfort even extends to two-up riding, giving passengers the ride of their life with matching lower pegs and a larger seating area. The fine-tuned suspension adds another level of luxury to the ride.
Effortless Power. The ZF14.4 lithium-ion battery makes the SR/S capable of a 200-mile maximum range with the optional Power Tank. The battery’s industry-leading power and energy density combined with an aluminum heat-sink housing and thermal transfer interface ensure consistent cell cooling and maximum long-term powertrain performance.
Effortless Power. The ZF75-10 motor delivers 140 ft-lb of torque and 110 hp, effortlessly propelling the SR/S to a top speed of 124 mph. Pairing Zero’s renowned internal permanent magnet brushless architecture and a passively air-cooled compact design creates class-leading performance and efficiency.
Effortless Power. Our scalable Rapid Charge System allows the bike to be configured for 3 kW, 6 kW, 9 kW or 12 kW of charging at any standard Level 2 charge station.* The SR/S Rapid Charge System charges at up to 38 miles of range per hour of charging (mphc) on 3 kW, 76 mphc on 6 kW, and 153 mphc on 12 kW, which can recharge the battery pack to 95% capacity in 1 hour.
Effortless Power. A proprietary concentric motor and swingarm pivot design provide the optimal architecture to ensure constant drive-belt tension and maximum torque delivery to the rear wheel. A custom designed large-bearing swingarm pivot allows ample space for the high-performance motor while allowing a slim chassis waist to enhance rider ergonomics and bike maneuverability.
Effortless Control. Cypher III, Zero’s proprietary operating system acts as a hub to integrate all motorcycle systems. It delivers precise performance seamlessly for a consistent and superior riding experience.

The brand-new, redesigned 2011 GSX-R750™ is the latest version of the original GSX-R - the championship-winning sport bike that is literally in a class of its own. While the unrivaled GSX-R750's only challenge is outdoing itself, the all-new 2011 model responds with bold styling and exceptional performance. On the road or on the track, the 2011 GSX-R750 delivers a riding experience that is a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, swift handling, compact size and light weight. The key to the GSX-R750's racetrack-conquering speed and agile handling is the pairing of its powerful inline four-cylinder, 16-valve 750 cubic centimeter engine into the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600 cubic centimeter Supersport. It's a winning combination that will allow any rider to experience the exhilarating rush of a middleweight AMA Supersport bike.

An aluminum kick-starter instead of the former steel lever saves weight and a new joint makes it easier to operate. To save more weight, the ignition cover is also made of aluminum. The 65SX is now equipped with a state of the art digital ignition.

Beneath all that classic style and those heritage-rich details, there's an outrageous spirit lurking deep in the heart of the Road King®. And here it is, rearing its glorious chrome and sheet metal head. The Road King Custom. This ride is brand new, but the style might remind you of the custom bikes native to California beaches. The kind that grab attention like a bull in a china shop. Note the pullback beach bars, lowered rear suspension, clean leather bags with hidden supports and slash-cut mufflers. It's got nickel-formed and chrome-plated tank emblems, a chrome wind-swept visor and bold, simple fenders over cast and chromed wheels. Even with all that boulevard styling, the Custom is made to go far. Air-adjustable rear suspension, refined chassis design and proven Twin Cam 88® engine, in carb or EFI. Check it out. It's Road King, in its most radical form. Availability of colors may vary from dealer to dealer, and is subject to change without notice. Pearl: additional $250

Spring is coming, which means a new season is about to begin. Now is the time to buy your new Harley Davidson FLHTCUI for a good price. The journey on it was not forgotten and, in my opinion, this is the best that there is from the touring class. It has been fully serviced on September 2022: all three Red Line oils, brake fluid, brake pads, and Dunlop tires. Plenty of space for any long journey. Cruise controls, music system and other things that will make the trip comfortable and unforgettable. A couple of months ago, I lost control and didn’t fit into the turn at minimum speed, so there are a few scratches on the right lower side that are not even visible from the side at all. This is the answer to the question why rebuilt title. The insurance company decided that the motorcycle should be written off and I am very happy about it. They paid me the insurance and I kept the bike for myself in perfect condition. I still don't understand why it would be beneficial for an insurance company to write off a motorcycle with no damage at all. In general, none of this matters.

The title in my name is on hand, the motorcycle is not pledged and not on credit.

By the way, about the condition of the bike. It's perfect, everything works. Just sit on it and go.

If you see this ad, it means the bike is still for sale. Don't waste my time and yours on this question. And of course, gentlemen nicknamed “I will buy your motorcycle for one thousand dollars” pass by, because I know the real price of my motorcycle and a worthy and solvent person will receive it.",excellent,gas,37000,manual,touring,silver,rebuilt,,,,,,,

2022 CFMoto 300NK
Now that you’ve seen the 300NK and the low price, the urge to ride need not be ignored. Hard to believe you get all this for so little. State-of-the-art engineering—engine, suspension, brakes, full-color TFT display, plus an assortment of components that make it all work together flawlessly. Own this motorcycle, and you will form a lifelong relationship with riding.
Features may include:
You get the best of both worlds. A perfect commuter motorcycle with crisp sport bike handling. The eyes say this is a clean, naked street bike. The spec sheet says this machine is chock full of modern technology. That includes the confidence-inspiring kind—Continental dual channel ABS. No wonder the 300NK gets our vote for easiest motorcycle to ride.
Full-Color TFT Display
Thin Film Transistor Technology is a feature you expect on a high price motorcycle. In this case, what you see so clearly is what you get—an incredible five-inch TFT multi-function display. At-a-glance information includes rpm, gear, speed, even phone connectivity. Two interfaces differentiate Eco and Sport riding modes.
LED Lights
See and be seen. You’re not just lighting the road. You’re a beacon of light for others to see. The bike’s LED headlights provide optimum visibility and a clean aesthetic.
Ride Quality
The 300NK might just be the most fun you can have on two wheels. Quality of materials along with fit and finish say a lot about the individuals who built this motorcycle. These people care about the details that go into creating the best riding experience possible.
Engine
Around town, 292cc making 27 hp is plenty. The incredibly usable, liquid-cooled, DOHC, single-cylinder engine with Bosch® EFI makes the 300NK the world’s perfect 100 mpg commuter. The gear-driven counter balancer all but eliminates vibration.
Slipper Clutch with 6-speed Transmission
The slipper clutch paired with the soft yet direct 6-speed transmission improves driving safety and performance by smoothing out gear shifts and increasing the power buffer zone. While downshifting, the slipper clutch reduces braking force and helps to match engine and motorcycle speed. Flawless shifts and light clutch action are your commute’s secret weapon.
Lightweight Design
At just 333 pounds, the 300NK is right at home in busy urban settings. The high-tensile steel frame incorporates the engine as a stressed member. Superior rigidity equals excellent handling. The progressive rate upside-down (USD) fork and adjustable rear monoshock take it to the next level.

It has a super fancy adjustable Touratech rear shock with a 150-180 TT rear spring, so you know it's going to ride amazing and handle the load of adventure touring with gear to camp off the bike should you please. The bike has been fully inspected, serviced and is ready to go!

Features may include:
The F 700 GS: The GS Feeling for Everyone.
Carefree motorcycling fun for everyone! With the F 700 GS. Its 75 hp engine and outstanding handling make riding child's play on any terrain. Due to its low weight and many different seat variants from high to low-slung, it is also particularly suited to smaller riders and beginners as an ideal all-round adventure machine.
More technology for more safety.
Thanks to the Ride-by-Wire electronic control system, the rider can control acceleration and deceleration more easily. Operating the accelerator becomes physically easier, due to an elimination of the mechanical transmission. The Rain and Road riding modes are standard features. The additional Enduro mode is an optional accessory. With ABS as standard and ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment) and ASC (Automatic Stability Control) as special equipment, your ride will not only be more confident, but more comfortable.
Made for you.
As usual, a wide range of options and special equipment are available for the F 700 GS, allowing you to tailor your BMW to your individual preferences. This means you can create your own individual BMW.

The WP XACT PDS shock absorber is fitted to the TC 85. PDS, progressive damping system, allows the rear end to stay stable over smaller bumps or rough terrain while also soaking up bigger hits with ease.
Technology
Airbox
The Twin Air filter can be easily accessed without tools, by simply removing the left side panel for quick maintenance. The airbox design allows optimum airflow and maximum filter protection.
Cooling
The TC 85 features radiators designed with computational fluid dynamics to ensure the ideal passage of air through the cooling fins for optimum engine temperature and the highest performance.
Swingarm
The swingarm is manufactured from a single piece of aluminum using a gravity die-cast production process. This gives the swingarm exceptional strength while keeping the weight to a minimum. Chain adjustment markings are also visible from above to make for quicker, simpler adjustment.
Performance
Engine
The TC 85 engine uses the latest in 2-stroke technology to deliver unrivalled performance in the competitive 85cc class. With an unchanged bore and stroke, the engine is1.5 pounds lighter and delivers improved power and ride-ability along the complete RPM range.
Cylinder
The cylinder is designed around an innovative power valve system, the system controls both the exhaust valve and the sub-exhaust port for impressive power, torque and controllability. As a result, the TC 85 delivers significant mid-range performance, reducing the need to use the clutch in loamy or sandy conditions.
Crankcase
Manufactured using a high pressure die-cast production process, the crankcases are designed with thinner wall thickness to save weight, while retaining strength and durability. This design also aids in a more compact arrangement, positioning the shaft arrangements closer to the center of gravity for improved handling.

2023 Husqvarna FC 350
Ride the smarter line
With the agility of a 250 and a power-to-weight ratio rivalling the 450, the FC 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, creating a user-friendly riding experience in all conditions. With considered revisions to the engine and chassis, the FC 350 comfortably retains its position as one of the most multi-talented motocross bikes on the market. Complete with a new, Swedish inspired white, yellow, and grey colour scheme, which is applied to redesigned bodywork, the striking aesthetics, improved ergonomics, and flatter seat profile, clearly indicate the continued development of the FC 350.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new FC 350 engine is designed to deliver maximum performance. For 2023, the repositioning of all major engine components and shaft arrangements enhances overall handling with the design improving anti-squat behaviour from the whole chassis. Weighing just 27.2 kg, the 350 cc 4-stroke engine is tilted two degrees backwards and is 8 mm shorter in height to further centralise mass.
Cylinder head
Fully redesigned for 2023, the DOHC cylinder head offers improved durability and serviceability, with Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coated finger followers to guarantee minimal friction and optimal performance. These actuate large titanium valves, 36.3 mm for the intake and 29.1 mm for the exhaust, which optimise gas flow for strong, usable power access the rev-range, all the way up to the 13,400 rpm limit. Revised valve timings work in perfect harmony with the redesigned camshaft which now features a new bearing bridge designed to increase stiffness and improve serviceability.
Ride easier
Lightweight frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023. A new shock mounting, which is no longer connected to the main tube, significantly improves the anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium metallic blue powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate, which is available as a technical accessory.
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 1.8 kg. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A new, flatter seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.

2022 Honda CRF250R
POWER WHERE YOU WANT IT
Horsepower is horsepower, right? Anybody who's ever raced knows it's a lot more complicated. Where your bike makes its power is at least as important as how much power it puts out. And that's where our 2022 Honda CRF250R is a real game changer. Because we've made some big improvements to this bike's engine, giving it way more power and torque in the midrange. And that means it's easier to ride fast, because the midrange is key in critical track sections like whoops, managing jumps, or blasting out of deep loam and berms. And to handle all that extra torque, we've also given it a new nine-plate clutch. Finally, there's the new single-pipe exhaust, a big contributor to the CRF250R's lighter overall weight. Plus, the pipe's design helps slim the bodywork so it's even easier for you to move around.
Features may include:
ENGINEERING
NINE-PLATE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY
Say good-bye to clutch fade the bike uses a nine-plate design to improve durability and hookup. That means less slip at peak horsepower, better torque transmission through the clutch pack and greater durability. Plus, the clutch pull is lighter, and you get improved engagement feel.
BIG BORE/SHORT STROKE
The CRF250R's 79.0mm bore and short 50.9mm stroke let our engineers create a high-revving engine with plenty of room for large valves. The engine breathes and revs the two keys to making power in the motocross world.
TECHNOLOGY
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF250R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
The CRF250R is equipped with an effortless electric starter. Convenient and lightweight, it's a huge deal if you need to restart a stalled bike in the heat of battle.
PERFORMANCE
MORE MIDRANGE TORQUE AND POWER
The key to riding a 250 fast is to keep it in the powerband. The 2022 CRF250R features a new cam, new valve timing, and a new press-fit cam sprocket along with new ignition timing. Together they boost the critical midrange torque and power significantly, giving you the advantage you need.
FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM
By installing the CRF250R's fuel injector at a 60-degree angle, the injector sprays fuel all the way back to the throttle butterfly. The engine gets a cooler, denser fuel charge for more power and better torque. It's little details like this that put the CRF250R up front.
HANDLING
REVISED FRAME RIGIDITY
Great handling starts with a superior frame, and that's one place where the CRF250R's chassis puts you out front. First, it's light over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation's. By making the frame's main spars narrow, we save weight, but more important we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.
SHOWA SPRING FORK
The 49mm Showa fork features a conventional spring design that helps increase the CRF250R's front-suspension precision, handling and feel. The fork's 39mm piston diameter and 25mm rod diameter are designed to provide a plush feel and supple action.
COMFORT
BLACK RIMS
They may not help you go faster, but the sweet black DID DirtStar rims sure look good.

TUNE IN TO VICTORY
Class leading performance and suspension along with the smartphone power tuner app make this the bike of choice for race winners.
Features may include:
ENGINE
New More Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder
The YZ450F's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design is now even lighter and more compact than before, ideally positioned in the frame for optimized weight distribution. Inside, the new head features steeper valve angles to allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port, as well as more aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint working together with a higher compression bridge-box design piston, DLC-coated piston pin, and longer connecting rod to give YZ450F riders the best balance of class leading power with an all new level of controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing track and weather conditions.
Electric Starter System
The YZ450F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Revised Bilateral Beam Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact aluminum frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Every aspect has been carefully retuned, with thinner main spar construction, thicker down tubes, revised top triple clamp, and all-new motor mounts that work together to optimize overall rigidity balance for excellent handling, especially in fast, bumpy conditions.
Compact Body and New Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. The new handlebar position is 5mm lower and 15mm forward and the seat features 10% firmer foam to assist the rider in keeping their weight forward during aggressive riding.
New Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The new top triple clamp design is resculpted to balance rigidity for improved steering feel, while the 4-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

2023 Husqvarna FC 450
Victory is a clear decision
Receiving multiple technical upgrades for 2023 to maintain its class-leading performance on the track, the FC 450 remains the pinnacle machine in the Husqvarna Motorcycles motocross line-up. A new engine not only produces a broad spread of controllable power, but positions the engine shaft arrangements at the ideal centre of gravity to vastly benefit manoeuvrability. Aiding this agile feel is the new chassis, which has been developed and manufactured using advanced engineering techniques to assist with repositioning the rotational masses to offer improved anti-squat behaviour for improved handling. Retaining the advanced electronics and high-quality components throughout, the FC 450 is finished with new functional bodywork adorned with white, yellow, and grey graphics, inspired by the Swedish heritage of the brand.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Powerful engine
The FC 450 engine benefits from advanced engineering techniques to deliver maximum performance. For 2023 the engine is lighter, weighing just 26.8 kilograms, and is tilted two degrees backwards to further centralise mass for enhanced handling and significantly improved anti-squat behaviour from the chassis. Servicing of the FC 450 engine is made easier compared to previous models thanks to the addition of service markers on the engine cases.
Cylinder head
The redesigned SOHC cylinder head is incredibly compact with the camshaft positioned as close to the centre of gravity as possible for significantly improved handling and agility. A new, more durable fine punched cam chain runs on low-friction chain guides for optimal efficiency and improved reliability with a single oil spray jet guaranteeing effective cooling. The lightweight valves are actuated via a rocker arm and feature timing specifically designed to deliver precise levels of torque and throttle response.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 1.8 kg. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
CNC machined triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A new, flatter seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.

Comments for this 2017 Suzuki DR-Z400S:
Low miles! Really nice condition! Come in and check it out today!!!
2017 Suzuki DR-Z400S
The 2017 DR-Z400S is ideal for taking a ride down your favorite off-road trail or ribbon of asphalt. You'll be impressed with the amount of torque coming from the 398cc liquid-cooled power plant as well as the crisp handling from the adjustable suspension. This ultra-reliable bike is completely street legal with an electric start and easy-to-read instrument cluster. New solid black bodywork with bold, contrasting color graphics makes the bike stand out on the road, on the trail, or even parked. Whether you're on the highway or on a twisty forest path, the Suzuki DR-Z400S can't be beat.
Choose your own adventure. For those who love carving corners and the call of the wild, our DualSport machines deliver comfort on the street, control off the beaten path, and full command everywhere in between. Get ready for an ideal combination of lightweight agility and crisp handling.
Features may include:ENGINE
A compact design, 398cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, dry-sump engine produces strong low-RPM power. Its compact 4-valve cylinder head features large 36mm intake valves and 29mm exhaust valves help produce broad, tractable power and torque ready for any terrain
Suzuki Composite Electrochemical Materials (SCEM) cylinder is durable, lightweight and provides superior heat transfer
Digitally mapped DC-CDI system monitors throttle position/engine rpm and adjusts ignition timing to maintain efficient combustion
Forged aluminum piston is 10 percent lighter than a cast piston and receives additional oil-cooling through a crankcase oil jet
A Mikuni 36mm carburetor is fed by a 6-liter air box to achieve smooth throttle response. The left side cover has quick-release fasteners for easy access to the air filter
Magnesium-alloy clutch, magneto and cam covers contribute to the bike's low weight
A compact 5-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with separate outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance
CHASSIS
A narrow frame combines thin chrome-moly steel tubes for exceptional torsional rigidity with minimal weight. The backbone tube, front down tube and steering head gussets form the dry-sump engine oil tank. A bolt-on aluminum sub-frame helps reduce weight and simplify maintenance
Long travel (11.3 in), 49mm cartridge-style forks with protective rubber boots, feature adjustable compression/rebound damping and adjustable spring preload for smooth performance on all types of on/off-road terrain
Rear shock absorber features 11.6 in of travel, compression damping/preload adjustments and connects to a lightweight aluminum swingarm through a progressive linkage system
Sure stopping power is supplied by a 250mm front disc with a dual-piston caliper and a 220mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper
ELECTRICAL
Electric start system provides convenient operation and features a lightweight starter motor and a compact 6.5 amp maintenance-free battery
Compact digital instrument cluster with speedometer, odometer, and twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, timer and stopwatch functions
On-road legal lighting with bright 60/55 watt H4 halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals and horn

A pouch on the rear fender carries the tool kit and owner's manual
Special design mirrors rotate to avoid damage in case of impact
Genuine Suzuki Accessories include a low profile seat, cargo rack, hand guard set and more
12-month limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits are available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP)

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 Husqvarna TE 250
High performance 2-stroke simplicity, and the latest in technical innovations, ensure the TE 250 retains its position as a premium off-road machine. Expertly assembled with quality components throughout, WP Suspension, Dunlop tires, and BRAKTEC brakes guarantee comfort and control for riders of all abilities. Smooth and usable power is guaranteed thanks to electronic fuel injection delivering unrestricted performance in all conditions with the self adjusting system eliminating the need for jetting changes and pre-mixed fuel. To underline the continued evolution of the TE 250, modern Swedish inspired graphics create a distinguished look for this incredible machine.
Features may include:
High performance
Engine
Arguably the best combination of power and weight, the TE 250 engine is a longstanding favorite with enduro riders. While technological advancements mean the TE 250 features a pioneering fuel injection system, it remains a low maintenance workhorse of an engine. Additionally, the TE 250 engine has an advanced construction featuring shaft arrangements precisely positioned for greater mass centralization, a counter balancer shaft reducing vibration and a twin-valve controlled power valve for smoother power delivery.
Cylinder
The 66.4 mm bore cylinder in the TE 250 features a twin valve-controlled power valve system which delivers smooth and controlled power throughout the RPM range. Optimal exhaust port timing is achieved with the combination of an state-of-the-art, adjustable power valve drive. The cylinder also features two inlet positions at the rear of the cylinder where a pair of fuel injectors are mounted. This ensures efficient combustion resulting in reduced fuel consumption and emissions.
STATE OF THE ART CHASSIS
Frame
The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium grey powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
Composite carbon fibre subframe
The carbon composite subframe is unique to Husqvarna Motorcycles and showcases advanced production technology and innovation. Using 70% polyamide and 30% carbon fibre, the 2-piece subframe has a total weight of just over 2.2 lb. With the help of computational dynamics, specific rigidity was engineered into the light and robust subframe, delivering outstanding handling and rider comfort.
RACE-WINNING SETUP
WP Xplor front fork
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for off-road riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping is in the left leg and rebound damping is in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
Hydraulic Brakes
The highest level of quality is guaranteed with the new BRAKTEC braking system, offering the highest level of braking performance while being specifically tailored for enduro riding and delivering a sensitive and modulated feel. GSK wave disks (260 mm disc front and 220 mm rear) complete the high-quality braking package for complete confidence.

The CSC RX3 Adventure motorcycle is perfect for real-world riding, including adventure touring, off-road excursions, sightseeing, or commuting to work economically. The RX3 is equipped with a proven and smooth 250cc, 4-valve, overhead cam, counter-balanced engine. The engine is water-cooled and equipped with Delphi fuel injection and electric start. For maximum performance the bike features a six-speed transmission.

The RX3 engine has a proven record of economy and durability around the world. The engine is also specifically designed to be low-maintenance. This same engine is a best-seller in Central America (where motorcycle sales far exceed that of the U.S. annually.) The RX3 has competed and been proven in off-road rallies in Eastern Europe. This same dependable RX3 counter-balanced engine is also found in the RC3 factory Moto GP racing bike that has competed since 1999 and won the 2002 Motorcycle Endurance World Championship.

The CSC RX3 Adventure is outfitted with an equipment package that includes 80/20 dual sport tires on steel rims, a tall windscreen, adjustable front and rear suspension, Black rear panniers and top case, front and rear guards, steel engine skid plate, and much more that cost hundreds more on other bikes. Other adventure motorcycles force you to buy countless upgrades, but the RX3 includes a comfortable touring seat, passenger seat and foot pegs, LED turn signals and tail light, ABS brakes, a full digital dash with speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, gear indicator, neutral light, and clock plus an analog tachometer. These extra-cost options are all STANDARD equipment on the RX3.

But the CSC RX3 value continues with anodized front forks, wide steel foot pegs with removable rubber inserts, a stainless-steel exhaust, a 4.2-gallon gas tank with locking gas cap, a 300-watt alternator for accessories, 12 Volt charger , USB port and handlebar switches for these electrical accessories. You will pay hundreds more to add any of these options to any other adventure motorcycle — if even possible - but ALL these features are STANDARD on the CSC RX3!

2023 Husqvarna FE 450 Heritage
Built upon a proven technical platform, the FE 450 bodywork offers rider contact points for greater control, even in the toughest of conditions. Highlighting the latest revisions, striking blue and yellow graphics, along with a white frame, create a distinctive look that underlines the constant evolution of this established enduro machine. Assembled with quality, high-performance components throughout, the FE 450 is capable of competing at the highest level thanks to the premium Dunlop offroad tyres, BRAKTEC brakes and clutch, and enduro-specific WP suspension.
Features may include:
Power on demand
Engine
Weighing in at only 64.3 lb (29.2 kg), the engine in the FE 450 is not only lightweight, but also features the latest technology available. This results in unequalled performance, ride-ability and reliability in its class. Additionally, the engine is suited specifically for enduro-type riding with an electric start, 6 speed wide ratio gearbox and an array of electronic rider aids as standard.
State-of-the-art chassis
Frame
The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium white powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
Perfect control
WP XPLOR front fork
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for off-road riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping is in the left leg and rebound damping is in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
Premium technology
Map switch and traction control
Designed for easy operation, the standard map switch selects between 2 EFI maps and activates the traction control feature. The TC (Traction Control) feature improves control on slick terrain. Traction Control can be switched on or off from the map switch. It functions by analysing throttle input from the rider and the rate at which the engine RPM increases. If the RPM increases too quickly, the EMS registers a loss of grip and reduces the amount of power to the rear wheel, ensuring maximum traction.
CNC machined triple clamps
The FE 450 features a 42 mm Hitachi-Astemo (formerly Keihin) throttle body optimised for throttle response. The injector is positioned to ensure the most efficient flow into the combustion chamber while the throttle cable is mounted directly without a throttle linkage. This provides an immediate throttle response and improved feel.

2023 Husqvarna TC 85 17/14
Young blood
Bridging the gap between the junior ranks and the full size models on offer from Husqvarna Motorcycles, the TC 85 is pivotal in the minicycle line-up. Featuring advanced hardware and utilising the latest in engine and chassis technology, the TC 85 is a highly capable machine in the hands of any youth racer.
Features may include:
Chassis
FRAME
Crafted to provide precise feedback to young riders, the chromium molybdenum steel frame is made using advanced robot welding and hydroformed tubes.
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
Much like the forks on the larger MX range, the WP XACT forks consist of a 43 mm split fork design using a capsulated air spring in the left leg and the trusted oil damping system in the right leg. These components offer remarkable suspension performance with 280 mm wheel travel.
WP XACT PDS rear shock
The WP XACT PDS shock absorber is fitted to the TC 85. PDS, progressive damping system, allows the rear end to stay stable over smaller bumps or rough terrain while also soaking up bigger hits with ease.
Technology
Airbox
The Twin Air filter can be easily accessed without tools, by simply removing the left side panel for quick maintenance. The airbox design allows optimum airflow and maximum filter protection.
Cooling
The TC 85 features radiators designed with computational fluid dynamics to ensure the ideal passage of air through the cooling fins for optimum engine temperature and the highest performance.
Swingarm
The swingarm is manufactured from a single piece of aluminum using a gravity die-cast production process. This gives the swingarm exceptional strength while keeping the weight to a minimum. Chain adjustment markings are also visible from above to make for quicker, simpler adjustment.
Performance
Engine
Using the latest 2-stroke technology, the TC 85 motor delivers unrivalled performance in the competitive 85cc class. With a lively but controllable power delivery, the motor delivers unrivalled performance and rideability across the RPM range.
Cylinder
The cylinder is designed around an innovative power valve system, the system controls both the exhaust valve and the sub-exhaust port for impressive power, torque and controllability. As a result, the TC 85 delivers significant mid-range performance, reducing the need to use the clutch in loamy or sandy conditions.
Crankcase
Manufactured using a high pressure die-cast production process, the crankcases are designed with thinner wall thickness to save weight, while retaining strength and durability. This design also aids in a more compact arrangement, positioning the shaft arrangements closer to the center of gravity for improved handling.

PERFORMANCE
SINGLE-CYLINDER ENGINE
A single is the perfect choice for a bike like the CBR300R. It's light, simple, fuel efficient and features a broad powerband with plenty of low-revving torque—just what you want in your first motorcycle, but geared for comfortable cruising at highway speeds.

COMFORT
NARROW SEAT & LOW SEAT HEIGHT
A low 30.7-inch seat height does more than help make sure the CBR300R fits a wide range of riders. It makes it easier to put your feet down at stoplights and in parking lots—a big confidence builder.

ENGINEERING
COUNTERBALANCE SHAFT
Because it features a counterbalancer, the CBR300R engine is a smooth runner. You get the narrow overall width and power advantages of a single along with the smoothness of a multi-cylinder bike.

STYLE
SUPERSPORT STYLING
The CBR300R features full-cowl supersport styling and dual headlights, increasing aero efficiency and carrying the styling cues from our CBR-RR series",excellent,gas,2431,manual,sport bike,black,clean,300,,,,,,

2023 GASGAS EC 300
Proven technology
Be more Taddy on the GASGAS EC 300! A bike that will take you anywhere offroad, it's a modern-day work horse of a dirt bike with the ability to make light work of the gnarliest offroad terrain. Built to deliver enjoyment by the bucket load, its state of the art 2-stroke technology ensures smooth and clean power that's easy-to-use. Requiring no premix and guaranteeing low maintenance costs, it delivers awesome handling and benefits from reduced fuel consumption.
Features may include:
STYLE
BODYWORK
GASGAS Enduro bikes are built to look good and perform to the very highest levels, which is why all of our bodywork ensures complete harmony between rider and bike, providing the perfect ergonomics and contact points for maximum freedom of movement. The updated design and new red plastics reflect our vibrant, Spanish personality while our straightforward graphics proudly say GASGAS! An ergonomically designed flat seat profile, combined with a high grip seat cover, deliver superior comfort and control in all conditions.
AIRBOX
There is nothing a rider can't love about the straightforward and completely safe no tools needed filter mounting system on all GASAGAS enduro bikes. In the workshop or out at the track, air filter removal and changing takes only minutes. Designed with precisely positioned inlet ducts that ensure maximum airflow and protection of the Twin Air filter, our Airbox allows easy and fast maintenance and maximum air flow.
HANDLING
FRAME
All GASGAS enduro frames are built using lightweight, laser-cut chromium molybdenum steel, which is robot welded for complete accuracy and strength! incorporating specifically engineered flex into all 2-stroke and 4-stroke frames we ensure riders have complete confidence no matter how gnarly the terrain. Together with proven geometry, our frames ensure playful handling and the very best stability. We then finish them with durable, red powder coating.
SUBFRAME
With a short and compact profile all GASGAS enduro subframes are made from lightweight aluminum. The profile helps centralize mass while also keeping weight down.
MOTOR
The EC 300 motor sets the benchmark for unrivalled power and lightweight construction. A 6-speed, fuel injected work horse, with a twin-valve controlled power valve, enduro specific transmission ratios and a vibration reducing balancer shaft, it is the perfect high-performance 2-stroke. Keeping life easy, our innovative fuel injection system does away with the need for time consuming jetting changes while also reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
OIL TANK & PUMP
There's no need for pre-mixing fuel with the EC 300! Instead the bike features an electronic oil pump that feeds 2-stroke oil into the motor, keeping it lubricated via the throttle body. Using engine speed and throttle position sensor data, the engine management's precise electronic control of the oil pump ensures the perfect amount of oil for any given conditions, reducing exhaust smoke by up to 50 per cent compared with conventional pre-mix lubrication. The advanced lubrication system maintains an average fuel-to-oil ratio of 1:80, which means one tank full of oil is enough for at least five tanks of fuel. Result!

2015 Honda® Shadow Phantom
Embrace Your Dark Side.
If you want people to listen to you, a whisper can be louder than a shout. That’s the idea here: If you want to stand out in a world full of chrome and bright colors, maybe more chrome isn’t the answer. Maybe less is. Take one look at the Honda® Shadow Phantom® and you’re going to know that’s true. The Phantom is for riders who want a great bike, who love to ride and who want to make a powerful statement. Its blacked-out 745cc V-twin engine, black rims with matte silver highlights, bobbed fenders, spoked wheels and beefy front fork all set it apart from most of the other customs on the road. The V-twin engine’s throaty exhaust sounds just right. And the Phantom®’s slightly more upright seating position is just right for both longer rides and boulevard cruising. Best of all? That has to be the Phantom’s low price tag. It’s time to go over to the dark side—in style, on a Honda® Phantom®.
Features may include:
Innovations
Spoked Wheels
Spoked black wheels and hubs feature a 120/90-17 front tire and 160/80-15 rear tire to complete the overall custom look.
Front-Disc Brake
If there’s one place you DON’T want retro performance, it’s your brakes. That’s why we gave the Shadow Phantom® a 296mm front disc for distinctly modern stopping power.
Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI)
Forget about fiddling with a choke—the Shadow's fuel injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes, and optimal performance in any condition.
Stylish Finish
Bobber-inspired styling with extensive blacked-out and matte finishes.
V-Twin Engine
Nothing pumps out the torque like a big V-twin. The Phantom®’s power makes it perfect for both around-town cruising, commutes and casual weekend-long rides.
Five-Speed Transmission
Wide-ratio five-speed transmission lets you cruise the boulevard at a low, unhurried pace, yet allows you hop on the highway without revving the engine through the roof.
Low Seat Height
Skimming the pavement at just 25.7 inches, the Phantom®’s low seat height makes flat-footing it at stoplights or in parking lots a breeze. And the Phantom®’s narrow seat/tank junction makes it feel even lower.
Gunfighter Saddle
Sleek, one-piece gunfighter-type seat is comfortable and looks great too.
2-into-2 Exhaust System
Sleek pipes feature bullet-style mufflers for that classic cruiser style of yesteryear. Large-diameter head pipes and 2-into-2 system design combine to put out true, V-twin cruiser sound.

PISTON AND CONROD
Replicating the advanced technology used by the Husqvarna motorsport department, the CP forged box in box piston features a hard anodized compression ring groove with an optimized cam and barrel profile while the new Pankl conrod features a bushing on the piston end reducing friction on the connecting pin resulting in the highest level of performance and reliability.
FMF EXHAUST SYSTEM
The Factory 4.1 RCT Muffler incorporates the latest in FMF Resonance Chamber Technology™ both internally and externally and features a blue anodised titanium muffler body with a carbon end cap. In addition, it offers a shorter overall length that is less susceptible to damage and moves the muffler closer to the engine to centralize mass. The Factory 4.1 RCT is constructed from aerospace grade materials that meet exacting specifications and is manufactured 100% at FMF's Southern California factory.
SUPERIOR QUALITY
BREMBO BRAKES
The highest level of braking performance is delivered with class-leading Brembo callipers and controls. The 260 mm floating front and 220 mm solid rear discs offer superior stopping power instilling confidence in any condition. A standard front disc protector is fitted protecting the brake disc from possible damage.
FACTORY CNC MACHINED TRIPLE CLAMPS
Made from high-grade aluminium, the Factory CNC machined triple clamps feature optimally tuned steering stem stiffness, perfect alignment of the fork tubes and precise geometry of the fork clamping with no ovalization of the outer fork tube, ensuring highly responsive and smooth fork action. Maximum gains in handling are provided by simple offset adjustment of 20 or 22 mm.
MAGURA HYDRAULIC CLUTCH
The high quality German-made Magura clutch system guarantees even wear, almost maintenance-free operation and perfect modulation in every condition. This means that play is constantly compensated so that the pressure point and function of the clutch remain identical in cold or hot conditions, as well as over time.
ABSOLUTE CONTROL
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
The FC 450 ROCKSTAR EDITION features bodywork which clearly showcases Husqvarna Motorcycles pioneering design direction in offroad motorcycles. The ergonomics are specifically tailored to deliver greater comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at the highest level for extended periods of time. The seat line and high grip seat cover deliver superior comfort and control in all conditions.

ONE ONLY ON THE FLOOR. COME GET IT BEFORE SUMMER! UPDATED 2/23/22
2022 Honda ADV150
YOUR DAILY FILL OF ADVENTURE
The 2022 Honda ADV150 continues to prove that the adventure category isn't defined by engine displacement or seat height. It's about the indomitable spirit, a sense of exploration, and a build quality that will stand the test of time. The ADV150 gets there with a rock-solid 149cc four-stroke OHC engine and rugged steel chassis. The long-travel suspension and spacious under-seat storage promise a comfortable ride for you and your gear. And features like the two-position windscreen, Honda SMART Key, and standard ABS make this one sophisticated scooter. It's versatility, with a heavy dose of fun, and an opportunity to add some adventure to your every day.
Features may include:
COMFORT
TWO-POSITION WINDSCREEN
Changing riding conditions? No worries the ADV150 features an innovative two-position windscreen. Want more breeze? Just lower it. Want improved wind and weather protection? Up she goes, no tools required.
CONVENIENCE
AMPLE STORAGE
Your ADV150 has tons of available storage. First, flip open the seat and there's a weather-resistant 27-liter main compartment that locks securely. It's big enough for a full-face helmet and lots more. Then there's a convenient 2-liter compartment up front with a 12-volt charging port perfect for your phone or other quick-access needs.
PERFORMANCE
RUGGED SUSPENSION, PREMIUM SHOCKS
The ADV150 features Showa telescopic front suspension with the most travel in its class, a full 5.1 inches. In the rear, a pair of premium Showa shocks feature remote piggyback reservoirs and triple-rate springs that control 4.7 inches of travel.
TECHNOLOGY
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES (ABS)
Sometimes adventure means not knowing what's around the next corner. Don't worry; the ADV150 has your back. Every ADV150 features Honda's Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) giving you the power to make confident stops, even in less-than-ideal conditions.

2023 KTM 300 SX
Maximum power at the least possible weight, amplified by low maintenance costs and smooth, linear power delivery - the 2023 KTM 300 SX is set to take the MX Open category back to school. Churning out more than enough power from an engine weighing only 52.6 lb, the KTM 300 SX sets the benchmark when it comes to power to weight ratios. Could the 2023 KTM 300 SX be the new Open Class president?
Features may include:
Easy suspension adjustment
Get dialed in! The 2023 KTM SX range boasts totally tool-free suspension setup at both ends. Thanks to an all-new shock absorber design featuring hand-adjustable dual compression control, it allows riders to adjust high- and low-speed settings in a matter of seconds. On the front end, the forks are also easily adjusted thanks to a single air pressure preload valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. We'll even throw the air pump in as standard.
Performance
The new 300 cc 2-stroke powerhouse brings a new choice of weapon into the MX Open category and provides more choice for racers looking for maximum power at the least possible weight. Along with low maintenance costs, massive power on tap, and an overall engine weight of just 52.6 lb, the 2023 KTM 300 SX provides pure performance. And then some.

Ergonomics
The 2023 KTM SX and SX-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high grip seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. The polyamide reinforced aluminum subframe further enhances rider feel and feedback.
Traction
Ready to rip your arms out of the sockets? Together with the benefits of mass centralization and an overall lighter feel, the anti-squat behavior of the chassis is significantly improved by changing the backbone of the steel frame concept. In layman's terms, the 2023 KTM 300 SX gets its power down perfectly when tearing out of corners.
Energy Absorption
Besides the expertly crafted, hydro-formed, laser-cut, and robot-welded frame being engineered to provide exceptional rider feedback and straight-line stability, it consists of specifically calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex. This means the frame acts as a shock absorber of sorts, making for a less harsh ride, resulting in less rider fatigue over many hard laps.

Comments for this 2021 Suzuki RM-Z250:
Low hours!!! 15-20!!! A few extras. Stock and aftermarket exhausts. Oil change parts, spark plugs, Tuner box and lead.
2021 Suzuki RM-Z250
The choice of wise professionals and privateers everywhere, the 2021 RM-Z250 is ready for battle. The agile RM-Z250 combines the sleek, race-ready appearance of the RM-Z450 with a versatile engine and responsive chassis to deliver superior performance. Using Suzuki's RUN, TURN and STOP philosophy, factory engineers have made the RM-Z250 a formidable competitor.
The RM-Z250 has always set the standard as the best handling 250 on the track. Fed by a dual injector EFI system, a center-port cylinder head and an AMA-compliant exhaust, the RM-Z250's engine delivers strong, usable power through the entire rev-range.
The twin-spar aluminum frame and hydro-formed swingarm carry a KYB-supplied suspension that includes a coil spring fork and a shock with four-way damping force adjustment. Strong brakes and ergonomically shaped bodywork that helps keep the rider in control as the RM-Z250 carves up the racetrack.
Tuning the fuel injection and ignition for maximum performance is easy thanks to Suzuki's smartphone-based MX-Tuner 2.0 and proven fuel-coupler system. Suzuki's Winning Balance is on display with the 2021 RM-Z250 as it maintains its own high standard for cornering performance.Features may include:
Superb Engine Performance
Center-port cylinder head increases output and throttle response
Dual fuel injector system boosts high rpm power
Traction management system helps the bike hook up
Suzuki Holeshot Assist Control (S-HAC) gets you out front
ENGINE
Fitted with a center-port cylinder head, the fuel-injected, 249cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-valve, DOHC engine remains proven and reliable.
The engine delivers strong peak power and superb throttle response through the entire rev range.
The cylinder head features a refined intake port shape and finish that fine-tunes the fuel/air charge into the combustion chamber to increase engine output.
TRANSMISSION & DRIVE
The five-speed transmission's second gear ratio and overall final ratio matches the engine's stronger output for outstanding acceleration and top speed.
True to Suzuki transmission standards, the gear shift operation is smooth and precise. Carefully designed parts like the precisely machined shift cam and corresponding gears create a transmission a racer can rely on.
The multi-plate, wet-clutch uses a rack-and-pinion clutch release mechanism for precise feel of the engagement and disengagement points while riding.
CHASSIS
The RM-Z250 features a frame and swingarm design that continues Suzuki's reputation for creating the best-handling motocross motorcycles.
The aluminum alloy, twin-spar frame combines cast and extruded sections to achieve superior front-and-rear weight distribution, while balancing strength and weight.
The 2021 RM-Z250 frame is 370 grams (0.8 pounds) lighter but has a 10 percent increase in torsional rigidity as compared to the prior generation frame.
The engine's position in the frame is rotated up so the crankshaft sits higher in the chassis to further the bike's nimble handling characteristics.
The rear, upper engine mounts are outboard of the cylinder head to increase rigidity and allow a direct intake path to the engine.
The engine mount material is changed to aluminum, rather than steel, for reduced weight.
The swingarm is shaped using an innovative hydroforming process that maintains strength but weighs 0.6 pounds (270 grams).

883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® V-Twin engine
883CC AIR-COOLED EVOLUTION® ENGINE
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.

BLACKED-OUT LOOK
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.

STREET INSPIRED PAINT
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.

LOW SEAT & SLAMMED SUSPENSION
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.

TUCK AND ROLL SEAT
A solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.

MACHINED 9-SPOKE WHEELS
Nine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.

DRAG-STYLE HANDLEBAR
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

I purchased this bike with 8600 miles on it, our shop went through the machine and made it ready for a good customer/friend who took his wife on their “trip of a lifetime” this summer and brought it back to me to resell as he doesn’t need a bike this large here in Washington. We installed a new set of Dunlop American elites just a few thousand miles ago. The bike has a chrome front end and a stage two kit along with a quick detach kit for the trunk! Other than a few scratches on the faring that have been touched up the spike looks as a motorcycle with only 10,000 miles should look!

This was a well cared for bike. The engine is clean, the seat upholstery and paint and chrome trim looks good and I don't see any evidence of damage anywhere. The mufflers have a little rust on them so replace those if you want your new bike to really shine.

Clean and clear title in my name, I'll even go down to the DMV with you to transfer the title so keep DMV hours in mind if you want to check it out. 2 original keys no trades cash only-I'll go to your bank with you if you don't want to carry that much cash.

This 2005 Honda Big Ruckus is considered by many to be ""The Unicorn"" of Honda scooters.  It was produced only for two years in 2005-2006,  a 250cc water cooled engine, retractable seat back, this is a unique model of motor scooters Honda is famous for.  We are told this Bug Ruckus was found for sale in the Mid West from it's original owner in 2007 and had approximately 2200 miles at that time showing.  It lived the it's life on San Juan Island ever since and now has just over 17,000 miles.   It had been serviced by its owner over the years, but we wanted our service crew to perform a full service including valve adjust and new air filters.  It has had two driveway mishaps but really minor and neither one was at any speed.  We have 2 original keys, the owner's and service manuals, and a clean WA title 

PRESS

Perhaps the designers at Honda were bored. Perhaps there was a military contract they were trying to attain. I can just picture it now, the phone call from a ranking officer to the poor schmuck who handles the new equipment contracts: “We need a new vehicle for Iraq… It’s gotta be big, and made of pipes, and it has to able to pull a tank out of a ditch… and don’t forget it has to look like a truck. Oh yeah and make it big…really big, yes indeedy, make it huge!”

Honda’s Big Ruckus has the most comfortable seating layout imaginable without resorting to a La-Z-Boy. The set up includes a very comfortable seat with a padded backrest. The backrest drops to become a pillion seat when riding two-up, which is effortless and comfortable for everyone involved. Your feet rest on forward mounted plates similar to those on most cruiser style motorcycles. The aforementioned seat also slides to allow simple adjustment. Unlike most Honda's we have tested, the Ruckus has a factory-installed side stand to compliment a well-balanced center stand. You pretty much just slide into the Ruckus 250 as you would your favorite armchair, put your feet up and ride. The engine, although not especially potent, provides a reasonable range of momentum through the rev range and has plenty of acceleration to pass most cars at city speeds and will comfortably cruise on the highway. One note about highway driving however: this is a very naked bike, which means plenty of punishing wind, especially at highway speeds.

YouTube - https://youtu.be/5Jrvcaa8MqA

Check out this 1981 Honda CBX Super Sport, it's only had one owner since new! The owner was a certified Honda technician in 1981, managing the service department at a local Honda dealership back then. He pulled it out of the factory crate and assembled it himself, has performed all its maintenance over the years, no one else has touched this CBX. One of the coolest upgrade we noticed right off the bat, he got rid of the NHSTA mandated 85 mph speedometer and installed the 150mph speedo and matching tach from the 1979 model. It also has the optional Hondaline gauges including ambient air temp, analog clock, cylinder head temp and oil temp, taller windscreen, custom hand built 110 led taillight/brake light, led headlight and Aux driving lights, there is also a power outlet right above the gauges. The factory saddlebags are in great shape, minor rub marks. We are told the CBX has never been dropped or tipped, it shows. The paint is over the top in nice condition, compared to others I have been watching for the last couple years online, this is one of the nicest. The paint is not faded, the red pinstripes are not bubbling or discolored.

In the box of bits that came in with this incredible condition CBX we see a full box of Honda memories. Service manual, owner’s manual, brochures, magazine articles, tool kit and more! I have not seen a better kept tribute to ownership of such a wonderful machine. This is not a redo or some bike that was never ridden. It was ridden, it was enjoyed, and it had the best care and love any motorcycle could have asked for.

All the services are up to date, tires are new along with other routine annual services all current, it arrived to us with carbs drained and fuel tank empty. Our service techs added some good fuel, connected the battery and it fired right up like it should, settled into a steady idle as anticipated. Hey, the owner was a Honda motorcycle trained technician! It's not often anymore that we take a 40-year-old vintage motorcycle from its original owner and especially so well cared for! We have the above-mentioned manuals and brochures along with all the original paperwork, full-service documentation performed by the owner over the 40 years. 3 original keys and a clean WA title

If you get that feeling of, “I should of, could of"" like many of us around when these were new, I get it. Heck I was young salesman selling these new in 1981, all these years later, I can personally tell you, this is one of the nicest virtually all original condition ones around. It's been sorted and can be ridden and enjoyed or just starred at.

PRESS

Honda had produced a Honda RC series six-cylinder race bike in the mid-1960s, but the CBX was Honda's first production 6 cylinder road bike. The CBX's advanced DOHC 24-valve inline six-cylinder engine was its outstanding feature; but in other respects the bike was conventional, having telescopic forks, a tubular frame, twin rear shocks and straight handlebars

Although bulky, the engine was wide only at the top. The width across the crankshaft was relatively narrow as the CBX had a stacked engine accessory arrangement, whereby the alternator and ignition items were positioned behind the cylinder block. This arrangement produced an acceptable engine width low down and moved critical items out of harm's way in the event of grounding. ""Don't tell me that its engine is too wide: It is no wider than the legs of a rider, so it adds nothing to the frontal area, and personally I would rather have my legs shielded by a cylinder apiece than exposed to every blow

Sport touring model
In 1981, Honda repositioned the CBX into the sport touring category with the CBX-B, detuning the engine and adding Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension, air-adjustable 39 mm front forks, a fairing and panniers with a stronger frame to support these additions. The CBX was given beefier dual ventilated front brake discs to help bring to a stop the bike's increased weight. The 1982 model CBX-C model differed little from the 1981 model, having only some changes to paint and trim.

Once again, we consider ourselves very fortunate to have the opportunity to bring another special motorcycle to the market. While this 1992 Ducati 851 Superbike was not a garage queen or stashed away in some collection never to see a twisty road again, this 851 was ridden, experienced, and likely enlightened a few riders to the ""Ducati soul"" they had only heard rumors about but never understood. The dry clutch rattles, the bike spits back a bit if you're not smooth with it but this is one of the most visceral Ducati Superbikes ever produced. These are special for sure.

From what we can piece together, it was a bike from the local market. Going over the records, it had a major service performed at my former dealership, Ducati Seattle in 2005. It remained in that owner’s possession until 2020. It went through one other ownership for less than a year, it was brief and maybe a bit disappointing as it was dropped at a standstill. The current owner is a long time Ducati enthusiast and a well-versed Ducati service tech. He went over the 851 thoroughly, had the paint repaired, went through, and inspected it all again as it had been parked for a few years and the major service was 10 years earlier. All of the fluids including coolant system and hydraulics were changed along with fresh timing belts even though the ones there were changed less than 100 miles ago. Our service techs gave a look over, nothing out of place was found, it runs, stops and makes you smile as expected. We have the service records from the 12k service, the tool kit, 2 original keys and a clean WA title.

Ducati came of age in the late 80s, using ideas that the Far East thought as antiquated and as such not worth pursuing, the Italians enjoyed staggering race successes, and with it many sales to the public, motorcycling hasn’t been quite the same since. Chris Pearson samples the bike at the beginning of it all

Based upon the 1978 Pantah bottom end, the design was the first real modern day Ducati Superbike and successfully bridged the gap until the arrival of the 916 some seven years later. The first sight of the all-new Ducati road bike was caught at the Milan show in the autumn of 1987 although the prototype race bikes had provided more than their fair share of clues and insights into what was waiting just around the corner. Developed as a direct descendant of the Daytona winning twin from 1987, the production version of the 851 differed little from that prototype race machine. Ducati’s intentions for the new model were clear from the outset being offered in both Strada (road going) and Kit (race track) specification, for those wishing to put their 851’s directly on to the track. 200 examples of the latter were hurriedly assembled to satisfy the homologation required for the inaugural 1988 World Superbike championship, a roadster based race series that Ducati were more than keen to be a part of.

The basis of the 1987 spec Ducati 851 lived on until the end of 1993, gradually growing in capacity up to the 888cc model of 1992, proving so dominant on the rack that the planned update, the iconic 916 series, was held over for more than a year finally making its debut towards the end of 93 ready for its full onslaught in 1994.

This attractive 2019 Ducati 959 Panigale Superbike really stands out with it's Artic White Silk bodywork and Ducati red wheels, stunning. This one was purchased new from Ducati Redmond in June of 2019, it's first service was performed there. We didn't get a ton of history on this one but looking it over we see NRC signals up front with CRG Arrow mirrors and a tidy tail with integrated signals in the rear, other than that, it is in all original condition. There are no signs of abuse or damage, we had our service techs perform the Ducati recommended annual service along with a complete hydraulic system flush to make sure this one is ready to go play. We only have 1 factory key, the owner's manual and verified WA title.

The track as a test bench, the stopwatch as an indisputable judge. For us victories and pole positions mean only one thing: the ability to build increasingly better street bikes. Because in Borgo Panigale competition and mass production are so close that they coexist. Technology, materials, innovative – and sometimes “visionary” – ideas give rise to unique motorcycles. Like the 959 Panigale, which incorporates the DNA and spirit of winning Superbikes to a practical level never seen before. With its 157 hp at 10,500 rpm, and a torque of 107.4 Nm at 9,000 rpm, this twin-cylinder power unit ensures user-friendlier, smooth delivery. The engine size increase was possible thanks to the longer piston stroke – increased from 57.2 to 60.8 mm, while the bore is still unchanged at 100 mm. To achieve the new stroke length, the crankshaft was redesigned to include a brand-new crank journal lubrication system – an absolute first for a Superquadro engine.

Standard equipment on the Panigale 959 includes: Power Mode, Ducati Quick Shift, Full RbW and steering damper. Power and lightness. Performance and control. The 959 Panigale achieves the perfect balance of these elements. The power of the 955 cc twin cylinder Superquadro and the exclusive monocoque frame create a unique mix of performance and ease of riding. Lightweight, easy to handle and controllable thanks to the technical equipment like the Brembo monobloc brakes with Bosch ABS, the slipper clutch, the advanced and adjustable suspensions and all the control and management electronics.

Every last detail of the 959 Panigale pays tribute to Ducati’s legendary racing heritage. The wider nose fairing and screen improve aerodynamic performance and add to the aggressive look of the new front end, also enhanced by larger-section front air intakes. The split tailpiece design is the final touch to a real work of art: the 959 Panigale fairing, now including redesigned lateral air intakes and new rear view mirrors. The new bike is also equipped with aluminum billet-machined footrests for enhanced boot grip while riding.

Last month this 2008 Ducati Sport Classic 1000 Biposto made its way to SUB to help find a new home. This is the same model used in the Tron movie remake and really popularized this Sport Classics series. It was purchased from MotoCorsa Sept 2008 and has only had the one owner since new. This Sport Classic was not kept in the garage and just stared at, it was ridden and loved. It has some sensible upgrades like Motolectric hicap/scdc starter circuit upgrade kits, a Shorai battery and the upgraded regulator has been repositioned to increase reliability.

This Sport also has a set of great sounding Silmotor exhaust and a remapped ECU, we also have the stock exhaust. It's not perfect, there are a few marks on the fuel tank as shown in the pictures and there is a small tear in the seat bump pad but a new one is on it's way. We don't believe the rear seat cover had ever been removed to take a passenger. The Sport was due for it's 15K Desmo service and some fresh rubber along with a few other small items, so we had service get all the work done and get this Sport Classic up and ready for a new owner. We have all the paperwork since new, service receipts, tool kit, code card, red key, 2 black keys and a verified clean WA title.

THE CAFÉ RACER STYLE OF THE ORIGINAL DUCATI SPORT 750 In the 1970s, sport riders were modifying their street bikes with some of what they saw being used on the racetrack, including clip-on handlebars, rear set footpegs, and 'fast' colors. This was done just as much for the look as for increased performance. The Café Racer style was born. SINGLE AND DUAL SEAT IN ONE The Sport 1000 biposto, features a comfortable dual seat, raised handlebars and classic twin shocks. A removable rear seat cover gives the Sport 1000 biposto the Café Racer look, but when removed reveals a seat for your favorite passenger. DUCATI PERFORMANCE The Sport 1000 is built with quality throughout. It uses high performance Marzocchi front forks with classic brushed aluminum surfaces and for rear suspension, it features a massive 60 millimeter swingarm, and twin fully adjustable Sachs shocks. The unique suspension layout of the Sport 1000 ensures that its look matches the classic appeal of the bike, while still delivering the superior road holding and performance you expect from Ducati.

We received this 2007 Ducati SportClassic GT1000 last weekend.  We did not get an extensive service history on this one but we did receive records from the most recent major service preformed.  Looks like in October 2020 it had the “15K” service performed, belts, valves, new upgraded Mosfet voltage regulator, harness and mount bracket installed as well.   New Pirelli Angel GT’s were installed too, mileage was 26454, less than 1000 miles ago.   When it arrived we tidied up a few items, gave it a thorough safety inspection and made sure it was ready to go. Service tells us this one runs exceptionally well and is very well sorted.  It is close to original condition, other than some SpeedyMoto frame sliders, bar-end mirrors, heated grips and slightly lower handlebars than stock. .Wheels and spokes are all in nice condition, the fuel tank fits securely.   We have 2 black keys, 1 red, the code card, some service records and a clean WA title.

The shapes of the GT1000 are modern interpretations of the classic lines of the original GTs of the 70s. The rather slim fuel tank features knee cut-outs on the sides and deep sculpting that allows a comfortable riding position. Full fender front is mounted with elegant aluminum tubing braces. The trim side covers remind us of the 70’s originals, and feature small venting holes for accent. Many of the details like the top crowns, fork caps and handlebar mounts are finished in polished aluminum, and are complimented with the chrome surfaces of the wheels, instrument trim, handlebars and horn covers. Finally, the classic look is completed with chrome full-length exhaust pipes and mufflers, one per side.
The rider’s position on the GT1000 is one of comfort and control. The chromed tubular steel handlebars enables an upright riding position to be maintained. A well-padded dual seat is sewn in a classic pattern and features ’Ducati’ printed in white proudly on the back. Rider footpegs are placed conservatively forward allowing comfort and good ground clearance at the same time. The GT1000 is a true two-seater, so the passenger’s footpegs are also sensibly placed for all-day comfort.

The advanced Desmo 1000 Dual Spark engine powers the GT1000. The torquey air-cooled L-twin is the perfect match for the GT1000’s comfort and performance attributes. Alloy cylinders, with their traditional cooling fins form the classic ""L"" configuration, reminding us of the original Taglioni design. Slim between the legs and exposed for all to see, the latest two-valve Desmo system, fuel-injection, computer controlled engine management technology ensure that the 1000 DS engine is powerful, dependable and thrilling to ride.

This good looking 2015 Triumph Daytona 675R ABS rolled into SUB a few weeks back to be placed in storage and perform the annual Triumph service. A month or so in, the decision was made to let this one go and have SUB place it up for consignment sale. We have had a few Daytona 675's over the years but this R model is very well appointed and definitely a step up from non R versions, lots of carbon, quick shifter and stunning looks. From what we have determined it was purchased from the local Triumph dealer in 2018 and only had 851 miles at that time. Looking the Daytona over the only aftermarket items we spot is a great sounding Austin Racing slip on (stock pipe not provided) and a Rizoma abbreviated plate holder. There are no tip over signs or any evidence of abuse or neglect. We have our most recent service paperwork, 1 key so far and a clean WA title.

The Triumph Daytona 675 and 675R supersports motorcycles are precision instruments that feed every bit of rider information directly to you whilst simultaneously responding to your every input.
In the Daytona 675R, we’ve made exceptional the new standard. This is a true track day tool. Focused. Committed. Taking our experience gained on track and road with the outgoing bike and combining the latest developments in engineering technology and thinking, we’re giving you an even faster, better handling, easier riding bike. The result is a bike which is 1kg (2.2lb) lighter than the old model with a new triple motor that delivers even more power all the way through to 14,400 rpm redline. The new frame geometry, mass centralization and race-derived Öhlins suspension enables razor sharp handling and confidence-inspiring feedback. Add Brembo brakes, a quickshifter, carbon trim and some subtle styling details and you know you’re riding a true thoroughbred motorcycle.
– Öhlins TTX rear suspension and NIX30 inverted forks offer full suspension adjustability.
– Brembo Monobloc calipers offer precise powerful stopping
– Triumph quick-shifter as standard blends gears and improves acceleration
– Carbon fiber cockpit infill panels, red rear subframe and red wheel pinstripes complete the refined R look.

The overall theme for this bike is more torque, better acceleration and more useable power.
One of the main contributors to this is the improved bore and stroke. We built the latest Daytona 675R with a shorter stroke allowing us to set a 500rpm higher rev ceiling at 14,500 and we increased power to 128PS and maximum torque to 75Nm. So the new engine now gives you higher power for longer. Wringing even more performance out of the bike as well bringing more of the rider out of you.

This is a very good looking 2010 Ducati Multistrada S was dropped off at SUB last month for some new fork seals and a potential consignment sale. We took care of the work and our customer decided to go forward with having us find a new home for it. This is a one owner Ducati, purchased new at Ducati Newport Beach in October 2010. While we had it on the bench we gave it a thorough in inspection and could find nothing out of place or any signs of abuse.

A clean Multistrada with nice carbon bits spread across it. We see the exhaust has the ""catalytic delete"" pipes in place and is has had its ECU reflashed to compensate, it runs and sounds fantastic! It has a set of fairing guards in place and a nice Givi top trunk We were told the 15k was performed a bit early at 14500, oil was clean, front brake pads are new, tires have less than 2000 miles on them. This is a clean bike ready to go enjoy. We have both Ducati factory keys, owner's manual and a clean Montana title

The Multistrada 1200, Ducati has completely redefined what multi-purpose means. The concept behind this bike was not just versatility but, in Ducati’s words, to make a motorcycle that is quattro moto in una, or four bikes in one. Ducati wasn’t the first to take a crack at big-bore, multi-surface machines, but it has applied a ton of technology to create a bike that can change its demeanor at the touch of a button. At the core of the concept are four distinct riding modes—Sport, Touring, Urban and Enduro—that the rider can select on the fly. And within each of these modes, load settings can be varied and include single rider, single rider with bags, two-up and two-up with bags.

The Multistrada may look like an adventure- or sport-touring bike but lurking inside is the Testastretta 11-degree engine, which is based on Ducati’s 1198 superbike mill. The engine’s name stems from the 11 degrees of overlap between the opening of the intake valves and the closing of the exhaust valves compared to the superbike motor’s 41 degrees. That cam timing, along with a lower, 11.5:1 compression ratio (compared to 12.7:1), makes the engine user-friendlier for the Multistrada’s all-road intentions. Yet it still pounds out 85.0 foot-pounds of torque while producing fewer emissions and allowing better fuel economy (we recorded a high of 47 mpg and averaged 38) than the superbike.

Conclusion: Occasionally we dance around conclusions, but this one hit both Kevin and I over the head within 20 minutes in the seat. The Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Touring is the best roadbike we’ve ever tested. It sits in near perfect balance at the confluence of its three main modes, Sport, Touring and Urban, without sliding into dull soulless practicality. If there ever was a “practical” bike that heralded the end of sportbiking as we know it, it is the Multistrada 1200S. Truly, now, you can almost have it all.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
You'll be the hero of the holidays when you bring one of these Volcon Grunt's home. Endless fun for the family!
2022 Volcon ePowersports Grunt
The Grunt is an innovative, easy-to-operate electric motorcycle that allows people to experience outdoor adventure or get work done in an efficient and fun way. With no gears, no clutch, no gas and no noise the Grunt is easy to ride and enjoy by off-road-enthusiast families, or those completely new to two wheels. Its torquey motor and innovative chassis lets it tackle the toughest terrain and conditions with ease. Work or play in a whole new way with the Volcon Grunt.
Features may include:
Motor & Battery
The Grunt's unique Volcon motor is designed for torque and efficiency. But while the 60-volt power plant can handle any terrain, the adjustable ride modes make it easy to ride and extremely versatile. The motor and battery are IP67 rated so the motorcycle is ready to tackle any weather. Because off-road speeds are low and trail riding taps into regenerative braking often, the Grunt's range is amazing. But if you need more, the Grunt's batteries are swappable and a spare can be carried inside the frame for a quick doubling of range.
Chassis
The Grunt features Volcon's unique Exo-Arch frame design. The triple-cradle frame and cast-aluminum swingarm are nearly indestructible. This is not a tall, tippy motocross bike, though. The Grunt's low seat height makes it easy to maneuver with riders of all heights. The oversize tires add to the suspension's smooth ride, and they float over surfaces like sand, mud and snow that swallow normal dirt-bike rubber. Tapered aluminum handlebars, a hand-stitched seat and mobile-phone-based ride control app deliver a premium cockpit for the rider to deliver adventures no other outdoor recreational vehicles can provide.
Low seat height
High torque motor
Off-road use only
Up to 75 miles range (with additional battery)
Three ride modes plus reverse
App based navigation, vehicle controls, and community

Reason being is that I ordered a new car and I want to save money for a down payment on that. It has a clean title in my name. I'm the second owner of it and it was my daily commuter even when it is raining up until it has gotten around freezing temperatures. It can still ride just fine but I'm a wuss. Take note that it comes with the top box.

I am asking 1500 bucks which I think is fair for a running and riding proper adventure bike that isn't pretty. It's not a dual sport. It is an adventure bike like a BMW GS or Ducati Multistrada.

Good:
New gold plated chain along with new front and rear sprockets
New slave cylinder
New clutch and brake master cylinders
Michelin Road 6 tires (I paid about 650 bucks for the set and they are fantastic in the rain)
Rebuilt fork seals
New battery
New spark plugs
Strong engine
Dual undertail exhaust pipes

Bad:
Left side of the instrument cluster does not work. This means no speedo or odometer. Everything else works.

This is the revised ADV bike from Moto Guzzi with over 100HP from a torquey V-twin coupled to a 6 speed gearbox and fed from an 8.5 gallon tank. This particular bike has been converted to Givi Monokey side cases for convenience, has new LED fog lights, a larger windscreen, a Givi Monokey rear rack, and I even have a Russel two piece seat as well! A prior owner converted this bike to use a Ducati front master cylinder and bigger front brake calipers, as well as adding the factory Euro turn signals and mirrors. I have also installed a mount for a Garmin Zumo XT GPS that is plugged into the factory GPS power harness. There's also a GPR exhaust that's way lighter than the stock pipe and has a removable baffle if you'd like to make some noise.

The servicing that I have done recently is as follows:
1. New air and oil filters, along with fresh brake fluid, transmission oil, final drive oil, and engine oil.
2. Reset TPS and rebalanced idle vacuum, as well as cleaning of the throttle bodies and idle stepper.
3. Replaced in tank fuel filter.
4. Replaced battery positive and ground cables with custom kit for Carc Moto Guzzis.
5. Flashed the Xlratr fueling map onto the bike for smooth throttle response.
6. Resealed the airbox halves and screwed them together for permanent clamping.
7. Replaced the alternator belt.

This bike has also had fuses added to the fog light feeds, which is an important tweak to do to the bike.

These are pretty uncommon and you definitely want the revised version with the bigger thank and the post 2012 bikes with the roller cams",good,gas,50020,manual,street,green,clean,1200,,,,,,

2020 Yamaha YZ450F
TUNE IN TO VICTORY
Class leading performance and suspension along with the smartphone power tuner app make this the bike of choice for race winners.
Features may include:ENGINE
New More Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder
The YZ450F's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design is now even lighter and more compact than before, ideally positioned in the frame for optimized weight distribution. Inside, the new head features steeper valve angles to allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port, as well as more aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint working together with a higher compression bridge-box design piston, DLC-coated piston pin, and longer connecting rod to give YZ450F riders the best balance of class leading power with an all new level of controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing track and weather conditions.
Electric Starter System
The YZ450F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Revised Bilateral Beam Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact aluminum frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Every aspect has been carefully retuned, with thinner main spar construction, thicker down tubes, revised top triple clamp, and all-new motor mounts that work together to optimize overall rigidity balance for excellent handling, especially in fast, bumpy conditions.
Compact Body and New Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. The new handlebar position is 5mm lower and 15mm forward and the seat features 10% firmer foam to assist the rider in keeping their weight forward during aggressive riding.
New Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The new top triple clamp design is resculpted to balance rigidity for improved steering feel, while the 4-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

2023 GASGAS ES 700
A playful single-cylinder, dual-sport performer, the ES 700 is a big-bore bike that's perfect for mixed surface riding. Branching out into the street bike sector and creating the ES 700 GASGAS, we utilized in-house expertise, fresh thinking, and cutting-edge technology to produce a bike that delivers a distinct and playful riding experience. All the power from the single-cylinder, 692.7cc motor is delivered through a super-cool ride-by-wire throttle system, which guarantees a crisp throttle response and gives a highly accurate delivery of the motor's linear power. The bike is also loaded with the latest in electronic rider aids, which allows you to fine-tune the ES 700 to be just the way you like it. And with a state-of-the-art ABS system, and Brembo brakes, you'll always be in control. And, if that isn't enough, the ES 700 boasts incredibly long service intervals of 10,000 kilometers, so you can rack up some serious distance in between trips to your local dealer.
Features may include:
STYLE
YOUR DAILY RIDE
The ES 700 features unique ergonomics that ensure maximum enjoyment and a very special riding experience. Turning every road and offroad track into a series of ongoing playgrounds, the lively handling and offroad inspired centered riding position inspires confidence and inject fun into every ride. Loaded with personality, each model stands loud and proud with its bold red look.
BODYWORK
So, so red! No one will miss you coming on the ES 700 thanks to the vibrant red body work and bold graphics. Inspired by our awesome off-road range, as well as being ergonomically top-notch, all panels wrap neatly around the frame and motor to improve the connection between rider and bike for total control in all situations.
HANDLING
EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING
Serious, all-in trail and street riding, that's what the GASGAS ES 700 is built for. And the exact reason why the ES 700 has exceptional handling, which allows riders of all ability levels to feel secure and super-confident, no matter where they're riding. From the steel trellis frames that ensure the perfect mix of flex and rigidity, to our super-strong, great looking, die-cast swingarms, and not forgetting the 3.6-gal (13.5-liter) fuel tanks that keep weight low, our street bikes deliver great handling. Finished with vibrant red bodywork, as well as being ergonomically top-notch, all panels wrap neatly around the frame and motor to improve the connection between rider and bike.
FRAME
Flex. Rigidity. Fun. The three most important things when it comes to our lightweight trellis frames. Designed to deliver razor sharp handling and stability, just the right amount of flex ensures an exhilarating ride on the ES 700, each and every time. Made from high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel to be super strong, precisely calculated torsional rigidity and longitudinal flex means riders of all abilities have the confidence to push harder, and ride further. They're robot welded too, to ensure accuracy and the very best quality, always. Oh, and they weigh just 18.5 lb (8.4kg).
POLYAMID SUBFRAME
We want everyone to get the most out of each ride, which is why the self-supporting rear subframe on the GASGAS ES 700 houses a 3.6-gal (13.5-liter) fuel tank. Molded from a single piece of high strength polyamide and weighing just 11.4 lb (5.2 kg), it's super tough and placed to keep weight as low as possible for best handling. Want to add either a dedicated mounting frame or passenger handles? No problem, we already thought of that!

Long travel (11.3-inch), 49mm cartridge-style fork has protective rubber boots plus adjustable compression/rebound damping and adjustable spring preload for smooth performance on all types of on- and off-road terrain.
Rear shock absorber features 11.6 inches of travel, compression damping/preload adjustments, and connects to a lightweight aluminum swingarm through a progressive linkage system.
Spoke-style 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels with new blacked-out aluminum rims are fitted with Dunlop D208 dual-purpose tires. The wheels are sized perfectly to accept popular dual sport tires and are set up to accept rim-locks when a more aggressive tread pattern is used.
Electrical
Electric start system provides convenient operation and features a lightweight starter motor and a compact, 6.5-amp, maintenance-free battery.
Compact digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, timer, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt H4 halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.

2023 KTM 85 SX 19/16
If you're reading this, then it is safe to say things have become serious. The 2023 KTM 85 SX - in big wheel guise - is the first real step into the big leagues. Lightweight, powerful and reliable, the KTM 85 SX boasts real big bike components in scaled-down 85 cc geometry, providing the ultimate kickstart to any young racing career.
Features may include:

Engine
It took extreme levels of ingenuity to fit the race-winning formula of KTM's bigger 2-strokes into a compact 85 cc engine. The super-compact powerplant is fitted with a 6-speed gearbox and delivers class-leading power and rideability throughout the entire rev range. The powervalve plays a key role in tailoring power delivery to suit track conditions and rider ability, ensuring that the only rider surprised by the incredible performance is the competition.
Airbox
The KTM 85 SX airbox is a masterclass in design, optimizing the tiny space available to deliver the best possible performance, while still maintaining the highest level of filter protection. The air filter is easily accessed, without tools, by removing the left side panel. The Twin Air filter and filter cage design feature a simple, secure mounting system, making filter maintenance quick and easy, which means less time in the pits, and more time winning races.

Frame
The frame on the KTM 85 SX is a scaled-down version of the multi-championship-winning full-size frames. Made from hydroformed chromium-molybdenum steel tubes that are robot welded, the frame is pin-point accurate, ensuring the highest levels of consistent quality and flex characteristics.

Footpegs
The KTM 85 SX has no-dirt footpegs, which have a simple but effective self-cleaning system that ensures the footpegs return to their original position, providing complete control in all conditions.
Decals
Rocking an all-new white and orange color plastics combination and orange seat cover - not to mention bold, black, orange and purple graphics - the 2023 KTM 85 SX lines up behind the gate with pure race-winning intent.

2023 Husqvarna TC 250 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new TC 250 engine is at the pinnacle of 2-stroke performance and weighs just 52.6 lb (23.9 kg). Complete with the latest technical innovations for 2023, the TC 250 receives significant updates with Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) reducing running costs, removing the need for jetting changes, and improving reliability. The addition of E-Start adds to the simplicity of this popular model and guarantees fast starting in all conditions.
Ride easier
Chromium molybdenum frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023. A new shock mounting, which is no longer connected to the main tube, significantly improves the anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate, which is available as a technical accessory.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A flat seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip, ribbed seat cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
Assembled with CNC-machined hubs, strong spokes, and black-anodised alloy rims by EXCEL, the wheels of the TC 250 are fitted with DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 Motocross tyres which feature a proven block-within-a-block design for more progressive cornering and superior grip. For improved on-track agility and stability through ruts, the TC 250 is fitted with a 110/90-19 rear tyre while a 80/100-21 front tyre ensures optimal handling on a variety of riding surfaces.
Technologically advanced
EFI
The introduction of Electronic Fuel Injection on the TC 250 brings many benefits. The ECU from Vitesco constantly analyses the running condition of the engine and delivers the perfect air/fuel ratio at all times through the state-of-the-art 39 mm Hitachi-Astemo (formerly Keihin) throttle body. The exciting addition of EFI allowed our engineers to develop two different engine maps, which can easily be selected via the handlebar-mounted switch for a personalised riding experience. Additionally, an important reed valve revision improves intake tract sealing and prevents excess fuel build up in the engine on extreme up or downhill sections for clean running at all times.

2018 Honda® Gold Wing Tour Pearl White
THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE TOURING MACHINE
This is a bike 43 years in the making. Rebuilt from the road up. Refined inside and out. Ready for anything. There’s a new engine. New front suspension. Available 7-speed DCT. All in a more agile body that’s over 85 pounds lighter. You’ll also find the latest in technology, including Apple CarPlayTM integration, and five distinct trim levels to suit your style. The 2018 Gold Wing is designed to push the limits of what a touring bike can be. And expand the adventure beyond anything imagined.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
ENGINE
The Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. We’ve kept that same overall architecture, but it’s an all-new 1833cc powerplant for 2018, and over 13 pounds lighter (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).
ALUMINUM CYLINDERS SLEEVES
High-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length. The 73mm cylinder bore and short, high-strength crankshaft also help make the engine more compact.
UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGN
The new engine uses four-valve, Unicam® cylinder head design. That improves engine performance and power, and also contributes to the engine’s weight reduction. The four-valve per cylinder design is also a big part of the new Gold Wing’s improved fuel efficiency.
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION
Want a manual transmission? The new Gold Wing offers the best conventional gearbox in Gold Wing history. Case in point: now you get an overdrive sixth gear.
HANDLING
DOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSION
One look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, new Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.
FRAME
This latest generation all-aluminum frame is significantly lighter and more compact than previous editions. State-of-the-art die-casting lets us fine-tune chassis rigidity, giving you both a smooth ride and precise handling.
SWING ARM/REAR SUSPENSION
Using our proprietary single-sided Pro Arm® design, the aluminum swingarm still houses the Gold Wing’s shaft drive. The swingarm links to the frame using a new, patented pivot structure that both increases stiffness and reduces weight. You get responsive handling and a smoother ride.
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
Have to make a hard stop, fully loaded and two up? All new 2018 Gold Wings are equipped with combined anti-lock brakes for excellent stopping power under a wide variety of road and traction conditions.
ENGINEERING
THROTTLE BY WIRE
The 2018 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system affords a degree of engine control you’ve likely never before experienced. It also enables features like our power delivery modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) which you’ll find on our Gold Wing Tour models.

2022 Husqvarna® TC 85 17/14
The 85cc class bridges the gap between the junior ranks and full-sized motocross, taking emerging riders one step closer to the big leagues. As such, the advanced hardware featured on the larger Husqvarna range is found on the TC 85. Featuring the latests engine and chassis technology, the TC 85 ensures young riders have the confidence to push harder, while maintaining maximum composure on track.
Features may include:
FRAME
Crafted to provide precise feedback to young riders, the chromium molybdenum steel frame is made using advanced robot welding and hydroformed tubes.
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
Much like the forks on the larger MX range, the WP XACT forks consist of a 43 mm split fork design using a capsulated air spring in the left leg and the trusted oil damping system in the right leg. These components offer remarkable suspension performance with 280 mm wheel travel.
AIRBOX
The TWIN AIR filter can be easily accessed without tools by simply removing the left side panel for quick maintenance. The airbox design allows optimum airflow and maximum filter protection.
COOLING
The TC 85 features radiators designed with computational fluid dynamics to ensure the ideal passage of air through the cooling fins for optimum engine temperature and the highest performance.
ENGINE
Using the latest 2-stroke technology, the TC 85 motor delivers unrivalled performance in the competitive 85cc class. With a lively but controllable power delivery, the motor delivers unrivalled performance and rideability across the RPM range.
CYLINDER
The cylinder is designed around an innovative power valve system, the system controls both the exhaust valve and the sub-exhaust port for impressive power, torque and controllability. As a result, the TC 85 delivers significant mid-range performance, reducing the need to use the clutch in loamy or sandy conditions.

Available at: South Bound Motorsports Bremerton ☎ Phone: (360) 233-8747
2023 KTM 125 SX
All it takes is one hard, fast rip into a loamy berm to know that the 2023 KTM 125 SX is a serious contender in the 125 cc race. Not only has the 'Ring-ting-ting' been given a fuel-injected revival, but the entire motorcycle also benefits from class-leading developments at every end. Boasting accolades such as being the leader in 2-stroke motocross innovation in the modern era, the 2023 KTM 125 SX simply slays the rest of the 125 cc class. All you need do is press the starter, blip the throttle and let rip.
Features may include:
Easy suspension adjustment

Get dialed in! The 2023 KTM SX range boasts totally tool-free suspension setup at both ends. Thanks to an all-new shock absorber design featuring hand-adjustable dual compression control, it allows riders to adjust high- and low-speed settings in a matter of seconds. On the front end, the forks are also easily adjusted thanks to a single air pressure preload valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. We'll even throw the air pump in as standard.
Performance
Designed to churn out more torque than any 125 cc 2-stroke engine to ever come before it, the 2023 KTM 125 SX is set to continue its dominance in its class with unrelenting forward momentum. With an overall engine weight of only 39.3 lb and impressive horsepower figures, this lightweight powerplant retains its typical high-revving character, while laying down the grunt where it matters most.
Ergonomics
The 2023 KTM SX and SX-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high grip seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. The polyamide reinforced aluminum subframe further enhances rider feel and feedback.
Traction
Ready to rip your arms out of the sockets? Together with the benefits of mass centralization and an overall lighter feel, the anti-squat behavior of the chassis is significantly improved by changing the backbone of the steel frame concept. In layman's terms, the 2023 KTM 125 SX gets its power down perfectly when tearing out of corners.
Energy Absorption
Besides the expertly crafted, hydro-formed, laser-cut, and robot-welded frame being engineered to provide exceptional rider feedback and straight-line stability, it consists of specifically calculated parameters of longitudinal and torsional flex. This means the frame acts as a shock absorber of sorts, making for a less harsh ride, resulting in less rider fatigue over many hard laps.

2023 Suzuki Hayabusa
The Suzuki Hayabusa has firmly established its status as motorcycling's Ultimate Sportbike. The 2023 version of Suzuki's flagship sportbike is propelled by a muscular, refined inline four-cylinder engine housed in a proven and thoroughly updated chassis with incomparable manners, managed by an unequaled suite of electronic rider aids within stunning aerodynamic bodywork that is distinctly Hayabusa.
Features may include:
The Hayabusa is instantly recognizable as its wind-cheating body preserves the cues that were inspired by the peregrine falcon the world's fastest animal. To bring a sophisticated appearance to the iconic Hayabusa, Suzuki's design team incorporated distinct lines and shapes to achieve an expression of refinement and ultimate performance
For 2023, riders may choose from three stunning color schemes: Metallic Matte Black & Glass Sparkle Black, Pearl Vigor Blue & Pearl Brilliant White, or Metallic Thunder Gray & Candy Darling Red. Each scheme features the iconic Hayabusa Kanji symbols and name logos.
The Hayabusa's legendary 1340cc, four-cylinder, DOHC engine is fed by Ride-by-Wire electronic throttle bodies with dual fuel injectors feeding each cylinder, mixing with pressurized air from the Suzuki Ram Air Direct (SRAD) intakes in the nose of the aerodynamic fairing. The symmetrical twin silencer exhaust system is lighter with better flow and a stimulating exhaust note.
The Hayabusa's superbike-caliber, twin-spar aluminum frame delivers a stable ride with nimble handling that can be personalized through the adjustable KYB-supplied suspension. Optimized aerodynamics and wind protection provide comfort while improved braking performance inspires rider confidence.
The Hayabusa employs an advanced version of the Suzuki Intelligent Ride System (S.I.R.S.); a comprehensive collection of electronic rider aids like Cruise Control and Bi-directional Quick Shift systems that can optimize and personalize the motorcycle's performance characteristics to match the conditions and desires of the rider. Only the Hayabusa offers this premium suite of aids that simultaneously boosts performance and comfort as riders enjoy the ultimate sportbike experience.

2023 KTM 125 XC

Nothing beats the topend scream of a 125 cc 2-stroke machine being ridden at the minit - and the 2023 KTM 125 XC is happy to oblige. Not only has the smallest caliber bullet in the XC range been given a fuel-injected revival, but the entire motorcycle also benefits from class-leading developments at every end. Boasting more torque, more tech and most importantly, more 'Braaaap!', the KTM 125 XC is the leader in 2-Stroke cross country innovation for the modern era.
Features may include:

Engine

Designed to churn out more torque than any 125 cc 2-Stroke engine to ever come before it, the 2023 KTM 125 XC is set to continue its dominance in its class with unrelenting forward momentum. With an overall engine weight of only 39.37 lb and impressive horsepower figures, this lightweight powerplant retains its typical high-revving character, while laying down the grunt where it matters most.

Wheels and Tyres
These don't only look the part - they play it too! High-strength, lightweight black alloy rims by GIANT are coupled to CNC machined hubs using lightweight spokes and silver anodised aluminium nipples. The spoke nipples incorporate a revised design reducing the frequency of spoke checks and maintenance. A Dunlop GEOMAX MX-33F takes care of business at the front, with a GEOMAX AT81 completing the package.

Neken Handlebar
All KTM XC and XC-F models are equipped with a tapered handlebar made of high-strength aluminum by NEKEN. The proprietary KTM bend delivers optimal control and unintended rider impacts are absorbed by the newly designed KTM branded bar pad, which features the same design patterns as seen on the frame protectors and tank spoilers - now that's a touch of class.

Fuel Tank
A new 2.24 gallon polythene fuel tank incorporates a threaded filler cap and an integrated fuel pump. The fuel pump features an external fuel line which is specifically positioned to make it less exposed and susceptible to damage, while ensuring a steady, uninterrupted flow of fuel.

Map Select Switch
Once again slicing into the 125 cc class with the leading edge of technology, the 2023 KTM 125 XC features a map select switch as standard, allowing the racer to switch between 2 perceptible engine maps.

Magnesium-alloy clutch, magneto and cam covers contribute to the bike's low weight
A compact 5-speed transmission utilizes a cable-operated clutch with separate outer cover for simplified clutch maintenance

Another iconic 916 has landed here at SUB for consignment sale.  This 1998 Ducati 916 Superbike was purchased June 2021 from the original owner in Virginia.  The 916 had sat for 8 years we were told and was brought straight to SUB to give it a good inspection and 2 year service. With that in mind we also went through the fuel system, changed internal hoses and filters, new fuel line o-rings,  The 916 was in overall very good condition, the last item was a fresh set of Dunlop tires.  The 916 only has a few minor modifications like the Forza carbon clip on exhaust, STM slave cylinder and a lovely carbon license plate holder.   We gave it a good inspection when it arrived last week, it needed nothing.  It comes with our service history, the original tool kit, 2 factory keys, owners manual and a clean WA title.

PRESS

Thanks to the gift of hindsight, we know that the 916 was one of Ducati’s most important models of all time.   Here is a quote from Mick Walker when the 916 came out.  - “The really big news for 1994, however, was the arrival of the ground-breaking 916. This machine's engine size matched its code number and had been achieved by increasing the stroke of the 888 from 64 to 66 mm.  This was the work of Massimo Tamburini, who has been described as one of the greatest motorcycle designers of the late 20th century – and with good cause. To many enthusiasts around the world, the 916 was not simply the latest superbike, but the best there had ever been. It set new standards of performance, handling, and braking, but also style and charisma. The 916 changed the face of sports bikes in a way that only the original Suzuki GSX-R750 had managed a decade earlier.”

We see various Ducati Scrambler variations in on consignment every year, but very few of these.  The 2021 Ducati Desert Sled was designed to be a bit more of an off road adventurer than its other siblings.  More travel, an easy riding position to stand up on the pegs and just an overall beefier feel. This particular Desert Sled was purchased May 2021 from SoSo Motorcycles and is still covered by the manufacturer warranty until May 2023.  

We were first contacted about a potential consignment sale this past summer, a work injury was forcing the potential decision to let it go. 6 months later, not enough progress has happened to justify letting the Desert Sled languish in the garage.  A recent follow up call was made to SUB and here it is, still in like new condition. The only modifications are the CRG bar-end mirrors that add a sleek low profile look and the NRC rear plate holder cleans up the rear. There is no signs of damage or drops,  Come check this one out soon, these cool moto's don't last long on our sales floor.  We verified there are no open safety or upgrade campaigns.  We have both factory keys, manuals, stock parts, and a clean WA title.  

PRESS

Ducati's Desert Sled is based on the homejob-custom “sled” that was popular in the '60s and '70s, primarily in Southern California. Named after the bashplate that protects the engine from terrain strikes, the Desert Sled was originally built around bikes that started life as street machines that were modified with wire wheels and off-road tires to make them suitable for soft terrain such as that found in Cali's desert areas. The Desert Sled rolls with many of the same features including the laced wheels that have long been the favorite of proper off-road riders. A high, tripleclamp-mount front fender comes straight from the dirt sector, as does the X-shaped wire grille that protects the cyclops LED headlight from flying-object damage.

Blackout treatment runs rampant from the front forks, through the frame and drivetrain with details such as the leading edge of the bill, exhaust silencers, rear mudguard, and heat shielding to tie the look together, front-to-back.  Up front, a set of inverted, 46 mm forks take care of business on the full trinity of adjustments as opposed to the rear monoshock that carries only a variable preload feature and rebound-damping adjustment. Suspension travel measures in at 7.9-inches at the front and rear; if you were wondering if Ducati was serious about the Desert Sled's off-road chops, the suspension rocks two more inches of travel than the more streetwise models, so there's that.

Power output is claimed 73 ponies at 8,250 rpm with 48.8 pounds o' grunt at 5,750 rpm. It flows through a slip-and-assist clutch that makes for a light pull weight at the clutch lever. It also adds a layer of traction protection by preventing excessive backtorque from developing in the drivetrain. That dreaded backtorque can cause the rear end to break loose on hard downshifts and when scrubbing speed ahead of a curve. A six-speed transmission gives you the tools you need to keep the engine in its useful powerband and sends the power to the rear wheel via a tough O-ring chain-and-sprocket final drive.

2023 GASGAS TXT Racing 300
The roots of the brand
Our headlining trial bike has the best of everything! Class leading power, top-level handling, and a serious amount of torque! Put simply, our TXT RACING 300 is a trial workhorse! With a plentiful supply of strong, clean, and tractable power on tap, all skillful riders can push their limits and enjoy unlimited possibilities. Not for the faint hearted, the 300cc 2-stroke is built to scale the hardest climbs and meet the toughest challenges head-on. With impressive maneuverability, low running costs, leading suspension, a strong and reliable gearbox for precise shifting, as well as a hydraulic clutch and brakes from BRAKTEC, the TXT RACING 300 truly does deliver serious trial performance.
BODYWORK
Restyled and red, red, red! What's really cool about our new graphics is that they're embedded into the bodywork making them super durable. The fresh look is applied onto our slim, ergonomic plastics, which ensures unrestricted movements and allows riders to perform at their very best. As all trial riders hit the deck from time to time, all bodywork is made from a special blend of Polypropylene, which is super flexible and returns to its normal shape after impact, even if bent 180 degrees or more!
FRAME
Strong, but with just the right amount of flex. That's how we build our trial frames, using tubular, 1.5mm 25CrMo4 chrome-moly steel for exceptional levels of rider feedback! Using advanced manufacturing processes, each one is crafted with laser cutting and robot welding. The end result is frames that are incredibly durable and ensure true trial performance. Weighing just 6kg, all frames are complete with a robust GASGAS-red powder coating. Lateral hangers made of forged aluminium connect the steering head zone while a new, larger skid plate provides better protection for the engine, lower frame rails, and linkage.
MOTOR
Powerful, light, and compact. The TXT RACING 300 motor is without doubt the most competitive in its class. Our engineers have never stopped developing the 300cc 2-stroke motor, squeezing out more and more user-friendly performance while ensuring maintenance costs remain low. Sharing much of the same architecture as the smaller capacity GASGAS trial bikes, the motor not only gives riders tons of smooth power, but the overall design also aids handling.
Features may include:
AIRBOX
There aren't many bikes that have an airbox with a such a clever design, but ours do! Not only does it house the top-quality Twin Air filter, but the overall structure also plays a vital role in allowing our trial bikes to be super slim. With easy access, filter changes are super easy with just one bolt securing our filters.
FACTORY GRAPHICS
Restyled specifically for the TXT GP models and red, red, red! What's really cool about our fresh new graphics is that they're applied into the slim bodywork during the production process, which make them super durable. No peeling, no scratching, just a long lasting, vibrant appearance for a super clean look at all times.
HANDLEBARS & GRIPS
Strong and lightweight tapered NEKEN handlebars are made from high-quality aluminum and fitted with Renthal grips for comfort and control. A unique bar pad design, specific to the TXT GP range, protects you from heavy impacts on the bars. Completing the controls and for a factory finish, the clutch and front brake master cylinder caps are anodized in our favorite color - red!

2020 Yamaha MT-09
EYES OF DARKNESS
The industry benchmark in hyper naked agile handling, triple cylinder performance, and dark side inspired design.
Features may include:
The Class-Defining Naked Sportbike
Packing aggressive style and impressive performance, Yamaha's original Hypernaked blew open the sportbike segment. Now wearing the MT-09 badge and more refined than ever, it features a potent inline-triple motor, adjustable traction control, a fully-adjustable fork, ABS, and an aggressive look unlike anything else on the road.
Powerful Inline-Triple
The MT-09's 847cc CP3 engine combines advanced electronic systems including YCC-T, Yamaha D-Mode and multi-mode traction control with a crossplane concept crankshaft to deliver an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character built around rider-centric control.
ENGINE
Advanced 3-Cylinder Engine
The MT-09 is powered by an 847cc liquid-cooled, inline 3-cylinder, DOHC engine with downdraft intake and ride-by-wire throttle control. With a 78.0mm x 59.1mm bore x stroke and 11.5:1 compression ratio, it produces an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character, perfectly splitting the best characteristics of both 2- and 4-cylinder motors in a compact, lightweight package.
Crossplane Concept CP3 Design
The MT-09's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept engine provides linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input, for responsive engine thrust with a strong feeling of power in the low- to mid-rpm range. To boost refinement and provide a smoother ride, the CP3 engine uses a compact counterbalancer to cancel out vibration.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Compact, Sporty Chassis
The MT-09 is built around a strong controlled-fill cast aluminum frame. The wheelbase, seat height, fuel tank width, rake and other dimensions are all set to work with the qualities of the compact 3-cylinder engine to achieve a sporty, light and neutral handling character, an upright riding position and a narrow feeling chassis at the seat/tank junction.
Fully Adjustable Inverted Fork
The 41mm inverted fork is fully adjustable for compression damping, rebound damping and spring preload. Not only does this allow riders greater flexibility in tuning their MT-09, the fork separates compression and rebound damping into separate fork legs, making it easier to fine-tune for the perfect setup across all 5.4 inches of fork travel.
ADDITIONAL
Comfortable, Upright Ergonomics
Enjoy every ride thanks to upright ergonomics that balance front-end feedback with do-it-all practicality. The tapered aluminum handlebar, ideal placement of the seat and footpegs, and ultra-narrow frame and fuel tank create an excellent sense of feel between rider and machine. The long, flat seat improves rider comfort, and is roomier for a passenger, too.
LED Lighting
The MT-09 features LED headlights for brilliant illumination. The quad headlight unit produces a crisp spread of light for confidence in low-light conditions, and is matched to a 3D taillight design for head-turning style.
ELECTRONICS
Advanced Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle
The ride-by-wire Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) system senses the slightest throttle input by the rider and instantaneously calculates the ideal throttle valve opening, and then actuates the throttle valves to actively control intake volume. This technology contributes to the rider's feeling of torque and controllability from the 3-cylinder engine.

Practicality Plus Performance
Touring amenities include a height-adjustable windshield, side fairing, adjustable riding position, 12V electrical outlet and a generous 4.8 gallon fuel tank. The FJ-09 is ideal for the daily commute, short fun rides, or weekend getaways.
Powerful, Controllable Brakes
Modern radial-mount four-piston front calipers squeeze 298mm rotors for exceptional stopping ability, while the anti-lock brake system (ABS) works to help prevent wheel lock during hard deceleration.
Top Shelf
A modern and stylish LED headlight offers superior visibility and complements the FJ-09's design. Multi-function dot matrix LCD instrument panel is designed to visually relay data to the rider quickly and clearly, including fuel consumption info and gear position.

"FS: 1999 Ducati 748 Biposto - 14,144 miles",https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/mcd/d/seattle-fs-1999-ducati-748-biposto-miles/7574549546.html,7574549546,"$16,000","FS: 1999 Ducati 748 Biposto ""Superbike"" - 14,144 miles - $16000

This stunning 1999 Ducati 748 Biposto “Superbike” was consigned through SUB a few years ago. It came equipped with so many period correct performance upgrades that had been added over the years. We believe it’s had a total of 4 owners since new. 20 years ago, the original owner started a frame up build at 7,600 miles. He ended up selling it before completion and the 2nd owner continued the build with the guidance of the original owner. The 853cc motor, we were told was built by Mark Sutton (DucShop), we have serviced it over the years and it is a strong runner. On top of the obvious visual upgrades like the Ohlins rear shock, the ultra rare Ducati Performance Carbon/Magnesium 5 Spoke wheels with 998 snowflake floating front rotors really stand out! . It has a full 52mm Arrow exhaust with carbon cans.

Once you settle in on the Corbin seat, you’ll immediately notice it’s not as aggressive a riding position as you might have remembered. The SpeedyMoto CNC machined top clamp with Tracstar raised bars, CRG levers, Acculign adjustable rear-sets and MRI smoke windscreen, allow you to change rider positioning. The slipper clutch set up was done right. It starts with an impossible to find, magnesium (green) vented inner cover, EVR slipper clutch with matching MotoCorsa Racing open cover, lastly an Evoluzione clutch slave helps reduce clutch pressure at the lever. Take a peek under the fuel tank, and the top quality BMC air filters with Ducati Performance carbon intake stacks stand right out! New quick change chain and sprocket kit was installed less than 2000 miles ago. All top quality components and smart combinations.

When we sold the 748 to its current owner in 2018, it had 11,946 miles. The previous owner had recently dropped it off to wake back up, and perform a very thorough 12k service. It had been parked in his garage for almost ten years. Once completed and ready to go play it really made no sense to let it sit again, it was left with us on consignment. We feel this 748 is as nice as they come, no signs of abuse, no track time, no excuses. It’s well appointed with smart upgrade choices, absolute unobtanium parts are spread across this 748. We found recent receipts for full suspension service and some parts installed by our friends at KFG Motorsports. Last year at 14,020 miles we performed a 2 year service with belts and a coolant flush. Since purchase in 2018 it’s only racked up another 2200 miles.

For those who are not familiar with the 748 lineage, this is the first gen 748. This really was the true little blood brother to the iconic 916 in every sense other than displacement and rear tire size. It retained all the technical features of the Tamburini designed 916 like adjustable steering head angle, dzus fasteners to easily remove the fairings, quick disconnect lines on the tank. In 2000 Ducati introduced 2 new models the 748S which stood for Sport and the 748E which stood for Economia. The S was a continued copy of the beloved 748/916 series with the addition of 5 spoke wheels and TiN coated front fork tubes. The E retained the 3 spoke wheels and gave up the coolest features like dzus fasteners and easy disconnect fuel lines. No more adjustable steering head angle option either. Great price point but lost some luster IMO. This 1999 version is the real deal, only visual change from the first introduction in 1997 is the Ducati logo and font.

We have 2 factory keys, an owners manual, 90% of all service records, and a clean WA title.

PRESS

1997-2002 Ducati 748The hot-blooded Italian middleweight was a mirror image of the bigger 916 but with a smaller, higher-revving motor. Handling was legendary and performance numbers registered mid 11's in the quarter-mile and 150 MPH on the big end. If you can ignore the idiosyncrasies it's a small slice of heaven.  Ducati’s 916 deserves all its iconic status and then some. But for many people who were lucky enough to ride both, the smaller 748 was the better bike to ride. It’s a long-running Ducati trait – the 750SS was more enjoyable than the 900SS and the later 749 was almost the perfect early-noughties sports bike where the 999 was grumpy, difficult to ride and needed to be going a lot faster than we actually went for it to work properly.  The 748 came out a year after the original 916. It’s easy to think of it as a sleeved-down 916, but the changes are much more than that. Bore and stroke are both different, the smaller capacity loses a bit of bottom-end power, but the lighter flywheels allow the 748 engine to rev much faster meaning the lack of bottom end doesn’t really matter.   It feels like a very different bike and, bizarrely, while the 916 feels like a massive, powerful engine has been stuffed into the chassis of a 250, the 748 feels like it has exactly the right engine for the chassis. 

If true Italian exclusivity boils your blood and concessions to politeness don't mean a thing, the Ducati 748 just might be your ticket to ride. After all, saying you ride a Ducati is simply priceless.

2021 KTM 450 SX-F
POWER SUPREMACY
The championship winning KTM 450 SX-F is a proven formula that is the industry benchmark. For 2021, this machine continues to deliver superior performance and easy handling. It features an extremely compact, single overhead camshaft cylinder head and together with the efficient electronic fuel injection, it pushes out an unrivalled 63hp in the most effective way possible. The KTM 450 SX-F is simply the fastest Motocross bike out on the track.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Unrivalled power
ENGINE
The 450 cc engine is the ultimate powerhouse when it comes to KTM's competitive motocross range. Its compact, lightweight design features a single overhead camshaft cylinder head, fueled by the latest electronic injection system. This enables the impressive power to be distributed extremely efficiently throughout the rev range. Even with its super-beneficial electric starter, this model is still the lightest 450 cc engine on the MX market.
CYLINDER HEAD
The KTM 450 SX-F is fitted with a lightweight, compact SOHC (single overhead camshaft) cylinder head. The design focusses on mass centralization, contributing to overall handling excellence. The overhead camshaft has a friction-optimized surface and valve timing that delivers impressive responsiveness. The four ultra-lightweight titanium valves (intake 40 mm, exhaust 33 mm) are activated via extremely rigid rocker arms. The rockers on the intake side are DLC coated, allowing for impressive engine speeds to 11,500 rpm. Low-friction chain guides further support the high RPM levels. The innovative head configuration guarantees the most efficient delivery of the unrivalled power, maintaining a strong edge over the competition.
CHASSIS
Superior core stability
FRAME
As with the entire KTM SX range, the frame on the KTM 450 SX-F is professionally crafted from hydroformed chromium molybdenum steel tubes that are robot welded to ensure the highest levels of consistent quality. The precisely calculated stiffness of the frame delivers responsive handling and works perfectly with the suspension to provide excellent agility and high-speed stability. All 2020 KTM SX frames feature a highly durable powder coating and come with standard frame protectors. The subframe is made from lightweight aluminum and provides great feeling for the rider, as well as easy movement across the seat.
SWINGARM
The KTM 450 SX-F's one-piece swingarm is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process for exceptional strength at the lowest possible weight. It offers a wide range of adjustment for the rear wheel, allowing for a shorter wheelbase on tighter, twisty tracks, or a longer wheelbase for greater stability on longer, more choppy tracks. The swingarm's chain measurement markings are visible from above, making adjustment simpler and more accurate.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Made for mobility
SEAT
All KTM SX models feature a seat that perfectly matches the range's dynamic performance-oriented ergonomics. The seat cover features silicone strips that provide better feel and grip for the rider. The seat is conveniently fixed to the bike using one long, lateral screw, making it secure and easy to handle.

2018 Yamaha Star Eluder
ELUDE CONFORMITY. AND EVERYTHING ELSE
The ultimate V-Twin bagger combines huge, emotional V-Twin power and near-sport tourer level handling with state-of-the-art comfort, styling and infotainment features.Features may include:
Engine
High Tech Meets High Torque
A massive 1854cc air-cooled V-twin powers Star Eluder with an arm-stretching 126 pound-feet of torque, for effortless passing power even when fully loaded. And while the competition promotes their new four-valve cylinder heads, Yamaha has been refining the four-valve, twin-spark-plug, pent-roof engine design for nearly 20 years, delivering exceptional power and drivability that leaves the rest of the class in the dust.Smooth Running and Charismatic
The Star Eluder engine delivers its huge torque with a thrilling V-twin pulse that brings excitement to every ride. And thanks to lightweight forged alloy pistons, carefully-tuned counterbalancers and advanced composite engine mounts, the Star Eluder creates a luxuriously smooth ride, whether cruising across town or across the state line.
Infotainment
State-of-the-Art Infotainment System
Mounted high in the cockpit for excellent visibility, the 7-inch full-color LCD display puts a huge array of information and control at the rider's fingertips. Controlled via touchscreen, handlebar controls or voice commands, this infotainment package gives the rider access to vehicle control and data, a range of audio sources and wireless Bluetooth communications options. The locking fairing storage includes a USB charging and interface port to keep devices topped up, too.Communications Suite
By linking a Bluetooth-equipped smartphone, the Star Eluder keeps the rider in touch with the outside world directly through the infotainment display.
Chassis/Suspension
Agile, High-Rigidity Frame
The Star Eluder is built around an advanced hybrid chassis designed for agile, confidence-inspiring handling, with advanced composite engine mounts that isolate vibration without sacrificing chassis rigidity. The main steel frame is precisely tuned for optimal handling, while the rear subframe makes use of Yamaha's advanced aluminum die-casting techniques to reduce weight and centralize mass even further. The balanced chassis gives the Eluder a combination of solid straight-line stability with agility on the curviest of roads.Centralized Mass
Thanks to the semi-dry-sump engine, advanced frame design and careful positioning of major components, turn-in and direction changes require less effort, for a sporty, responsive ride with less fatigue.
Additional
LED Lighting
Long rides don't stop when the sun goes down, so the Star Eluder features all-LED lighting to maximize illumination. LED brake lights and turn signals boost visibility, while the quad LED headlight assembly punches a huge hole in the darkness with crisp, bright light. And since LED technology uses less power and lasts longer than traditional bulbs, Star Eluder owners can spend more time concentrating on riding.Advanced Luggage System
Star Eluder features a pair of cavernous saddlebags as well as two upper and one lower fairing storage compartments. To provide both convenience and security, the USB-equipped fairing storage compartment and saddlebags feature electric locking lids straight from the factory.

This is an Italy home market only scooter, never officially exported to the States. Very rare, I've never seen one. The official model name is TR 350 but it has a 50cc engine so no motorcycle endorsement needed. Perfect for zipping around city traffic and going to shows in the Summer. You'll have the only one in Washington, I doubt there's more than a dozen in the States.

Complete and all original
Matching number engine
CEV lights and electronics
Dellorto SHA1414 carburetor
orig air cleaner (impossible to find)
Pirelli tires
Comes with an old Italian motorcycle magazine from January 1967 too

Engine froze but it's a 2 stroke so that makes getting it running much easier. The engine is a normal Jawa 50 engine so parts are available if you need them. It won't take much to get it back on the road. I bought this bike and like most all vintage motorcycles the title was lost but I took the steps to get a title and now it comes with a title ready to transfer into your name - no state patrol inspection needed.

I don't do email very much so send your phone number if interested and I'll call you. Not really interested in trades but might be for the right gu nor motorcycle trade and delivery is possible.

Description
Iron 883™
EVERYTHING YOU NEED, NOTHING YOU DON’T.
2020 Iron 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson® Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look.
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber. And black front forks with gators to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black-as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution® Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

""Garage Queen"" always stored in the garage, regular wipe downs, removable shield, has foot bar/crash bar and tail rack for a rear bag.

Beautiful bike. Nothing wrong with it. Regular oil changes. I ride at least once a month even in cold weather. (just dress like going snowmobiling) Windshield is really nice when it's below 50 or even 60. I prefer the look and feel of the bike without the shield, but it really does a nice job of blocking the wind making the ride much nicer. I prefer the ride in summer without the shield, and the look.

I just don't have the time to ride it like it deserves. No long trips to Beartooth pass in the future so I don't need a big cruiser like this to zoom around on short rides. Could use the cash, asking $19,500 obo. I don't need to sell it so no biggie if I keep it. Ride to Winthrop is always fun.

I don't need help selling it, no scams thank you. In person transactions only. Test ride with cash in hand to buy the bike outright in case of a whoopsie.

-New Coils, plugs, and plug wires
-Full top end rebuild (rings, lapped valves, head and valve cover gaskets)
-Restored (and repainted) gas tank, inside is pristine, could use a clear coat on the exterior

-Petcock
-Rear shocks
-Rebuilt front Forks

-New front brake & controls

NEEDED: Brake light & license plate mount, turn signal relay, and main fuse?

After we put this back together, all four cylinders had fantastic compression, between 120-125. We fired it up and there is a rattle coming from the engine despite it running well. After some research, I believe this is the cam chain, or possibly just the tensioner. It sat for a couple more months, and then refused to light up or turn over at all, leading me to believe the main fuse has gone. Engine is NOT seized, kicking turns it over and shows its healthy compression.

Ultimately, this Bike is at 80%, and just needs someone with a little more interest to come along and get her finished up. Obviously no test rides, must come prepared to tow home.

Clean title, tons of parts left over from disassembly.

Price is somewhat negotiable. I have upwards of $3000 in parts on this bike, and am selling for a huge loss due to not finishing the project.",good,gas,19000,manual,street,green,clean,750,,,,,,

Garage kept.

Some scratches on the bikes from my kids learning to ride front number plate cracked on the black bike but I glued back together See pics. Does not affect rideability. can buy the plastics very cheaply online if desired

Title in hand ready for sale.

Both bikes have maybe 5 hours of ride time on them. Only ridden around the block never off-road. Oil was changed after the initial break-in and once more at the beginning of 2022 summer. I just rebuilt both carbs as well before listing.

2023 Husqvarna® 701 Enduro

Price: $12,999.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® 701 Enduro
Knowing no boundaries, the versatile 701 Enduro is incredibly proficient within urban environments and truly excels on its favoured offroad terrain. Inspired by the brand's enduro world championship winning machines and manufactured with advanced engineering techniques, together with state-of-the-art electronics and multiple rider aids, the 701 Enduro delivers unrivalled performance.
Features may include:
Precisely engineered
Frame
The lightweight trellis frame is made of high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel and developed to ensure precise handling and instil complete confidence in the rider. Detailed feedback is transmitted to the rider thanks to precisely calculated torsional rigidity and longitudinal flex.
Polyamide rear subframe and tank
The self-supporting rear subframe with integrated 3.4 gal (13 liter) fuel tank is perfectly positioned for the best possible weight distribution. Produced in a thermoplastic rotational moulding process, the single-piece construction weighs only 11.4 lbs (5.2 kg) and is made of high-strength polyamide.
A masterpiece
Engine
The single overhead camshaft, liquid cooled, single cylinder engine features the latest in design and electronic technology. An outstanding maximum power output of 55 kW (74 hp) at 8,000 rpm and torque of 73,5 Nm at 6,500 rpm leave the rider in no doubt of the performance packed inside this lightweight unit.
Cylinder head
The compact design of the single overhead camshaft, 4-valve cylinder head features 42 mm intake valves and 34 mm exhaust valves actuated by a robust rocker arm system which delivers precise valve timing at high engine speeds. Ignition is via a dual spark plug layout, each of which has an individual ignition timing control for optimal fuel combustion in the large bore combustion chamber.
Perfect control
Wheels
Black D.I.D rims made of high strength aluminum alloy add an aggressive and modern look to the 701 Enduro. The offroad capabilities of the 701 Enduro are underlined by the 21"" front and 18"" rear wheel diameter.
Brakes
The latest ABS technology from Bosch is combined with high performance brakes from Brembo: a two piston floating caliper and disc at the front as well as a single piston caliper and disc at the rear (both floating wave discs, 300 and 240 mm diameter respectively). The latest corner sensitive ABS technology from Bosch guarantees maximum braking confidence and can be fully disengaged for more advanced riders.
Premium technology
Bodywork
Sleek, modern bodywork is ergonomically designed to connect the rider to the motorcycle and allow for unrestricted movement in all situations. The riding experience is further enhanced by the extended seat, which reaches over the radiator shrouds for improved grip and control in tighter corners. Additionally, a USB socket is neatly positioned behind the headlight mask for a convenient and continuous power supply for all navigational devices.
CNC-machined triple clamps
As on the other major components of the chassis, the anodized CNC-machined triple clamps have a precisely engineered flex designed to allow the fork tubes to flex under stress. This gives the rider more feeling under braking and on rough terrain.

2023 Husqvarna® TC 125 Heritage

Price: $8,149.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® TC 125 Heritage
Built upon the proven technical platform of the 2023 range, the Heritage models are modern, competition-focused machines with a vintage-style livery. The distinctive new look was inspired by the brand's racing design from 1983, and enhanced further with black anodised EXCEL rims to create an understated and exclusive new appearance. Characterised by the unique look and matching blue seat cover, the Heritage models pay homage to the strong Swedish roots of Husqvarna Motorcycles.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new TC 125 engine sets the standard for performance in the highly competitive 125cc class and weighs in at just 39.4 lb. The lightweight engine features the latest innovations to produce more torque while retaining its high-revving 2-stroke character. These revisions ensure both beginners and seasoned professionals can ride faster on the race track while further centralisation of rotating mass inside the engine significantly benefits the overall handling of the TC 125.
Ride easier
Chromium molybdenum frame
The proven chromium molybdenum steel frame is refined for 2023. A new shock mounting, which is no longer connected to the main tube, significantly improves the anti-squat behaviour of the chassis. With optimised wall thickness in high stress areas improving reliability, the frame continues to offer advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption, and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium white powder coating with redesigned standard frame protectors offering superior protection, durability, and grip in any condition. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate, which is available as a technical accessory.
Effortless ergonomics
Functional bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to allow riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points and surfaces in the rider triangle have been repositioned for 2023 to improve comfort on the motorcycle. A flat seat offers unrestricted movement with a high grip, ribbed seat cover ensuring riders stay firmly in place under hard acceleration.
Master your art
Wheels and tyres
Assembled with CNC-machined hubs, strong spokes, and black-anodised alloy rims by EXCEL, the wheels of the TC 125 are fitted with DUNLOP GEOMAX MX33 Motocross tyres which feature a proven block-within-a-block design for more progressive cornering and superior grip. For improved on-track agility, the TC 125 is fitted with a 100/90-19 rear tyre while a 80/100-21 front tyre ensures optimal handling on a variety of riding surfaces.
Technologically advanced
EFI
The implementation of Electronic Fuel Injection on the TC 125 brings many benefits. The ECU constantly analyses the running condition of the engine and guarantees to deliver the perfect air/fuel ratio at all times through the state-of-the-art 39 mm Hitachi-Astemo (formerly Keihin) throttle body. EFI also introduces two different engine maps, which can easily be selected via the handlebar-mounted switch for a personalised riding experience. Additionally, a redesigned reed valve system improves intake tract sealing and prevents excess fuel building up and creating rich running of the engine in extreme up or downhill sections.

2023 Husqvarna 701 Enduro
Knowing no boundaries, the versatile 701 Enduro is incredibly proficient within urban environments and truly excels on its favoured offroad terrain. Inspired by the brand's enduro world championship winning machines and manufactured with advanced engineering techniques, together with state-of-the-art electronics and multiple rider aids, the 701 Enduro delivers unrivalled performance.
Features may include:
Precisely engineered
Frame
The lightweight trellis frame is made of high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel and developed to ensure precise handling and instil complete confidence in the rider. Detailed feedback is transmitted to the rider thanks to precisely calculated torsional rigidity and longitudinal flex.
Polyamide rear subframe and tank
The self-supporting rear subframe with integrated 3.4 gal (13 liter) fuel tank is perfectly positioned for the best possible weight distribution. Produced in a thermoplastic rotational moulding process, the single-piece construction weighs only 11.4 lbs (5.2 kg) and is made of high-strength polyamide.
A masterpiece
Engine
The single overhead camshaft, liquid cooled, single cylinder engine features the latest in design and electronic technology. An outstanding maximum power output of 55 kW (74 hp) at 8,000 rpm and torque of 73,5 Nm at 6,500 rpm leave the rider in no doubt of the performance packed inside this lightweight unit.
Cylinder head
The compact design of the single overhead camshaft, 4-valve cylinder head features 42 mm intake valves and 34 mm exhaust valves actuated by a robust rocker arm system which delivers precise valve timing at high engine speeds. Ignition is via a dual spark plug layout, each of which has an individual ignition timing control for optimal fuel combustion in the large bore combustion chamber.
Perfect control
Wheels
Black D.I.D rims made of high strength aluminum alloy add an aggressive and modern look to the 701 Enduro. The offroad capabilities of the 701 Enduro are underlined by the 21 front and 18 rear wheel diameter.
Brakes
The latest ABS technology from Bosch is combined with high performance brakes from Brembo: a two piston floating caliper and disc at the front as well as a single piston caliper and disc at the rear (both floating wave discs, 300 and 240 mm diameter respectively). The latest corner sensitive ABS technology from Bosch guarantees maximum braking confidence and can be fully disengaged for more advanced riders.
Premium technology
Bodywork
Sleek, modern bodywork is ergonomically designed to connect the rider to the motorcycle and allow for unrestricted movement in all situations. The riding experience is further enhanced by the extended seat, which reaches over the radiator shrouds for improved grip and control in tighter corners. Additionally, a USB socket is neatly positioned behind the headlight mask for a convenient and continuous power supply for all navigational devices.
CNC-machined triple clamps
As on the other major components of the chassis, the anodized CNC-machined triple clamps have a precisely engineered flex designed to allow the fork tubes to flex under stress. This gives the rider more feeling under braking and on rough terrain.

OFF-ROAD LIKE NEVER BEFORE
Featuring confident handling, KLX140R motorcycles are the ideal entry into off-road riding. The easy-to-ride KLX140R lineup offers a 144cc engine, plush suspension and push button electric start, making for great trailblazers.
Features may include:
CONFIDENT HANDLING
LIGHTWEIGHT RIGID FRAME
A lightweight box-section perimeter frame made from high-tensile steel provides exceptional rigidity and strength. The narrow profile contributes to an easier rider grip and smoother movement on the bike. Working together, the highly capable suspension and lightweight chassis deliver handling that exudes confidence.
The KLX140R L trail bike features larger wheels (19F, 16R), taller seat height (31.5-inch) and higher 10-inch ground clearance, while the KLX140R F trail bike features full-size wheels (21F, 18R) and 12.4-inch ground clearance.
SMOOTH POWER
ELECTRIC START
The high-revving, 144cc, air-cooled SOHC 4-stroke engine easily starts with the push of a button. Air-cooling eliminates the need for radiators, keeping the chassis slim and lightweight while a 5-speed transmission with manual clutch delivers smooth shifting and acceleration.
RELIABLE BRAKING
FRONT AND REAR DISC BRAKES
Front and rear disc brakes provide strong progressive stopping power. The 220mm front petal disc with a dual-piston caliper is complemented by a 186mm rear petal disc with single-piston caliper, inspiring confidence on the trails.
Larger wheels (19F, 16R), taller seat height (31.5-inch) and higher 10-inch ground clearance

South Bound Motorsports Edition 2020 300 XCW TPI Six Days! Plenty of accessories added to this BEAST as well.
2020 KTM 300 XC-W Six Days TPI
THE PINNACLE OF ENDURO
No other brand stands up to the success of KTM when it comes to enduro, and this is clearly evident in the biggest competition on the calendar, the 'International Six Days Enduro' (ISDE). From its humble beginnings, the ISDE has turned into the team world championship of the Enduro scene. This Enduro marathon demands as much from the bikes as it does from the riders, and every year, more than half of them show up on Orange. The 2019 International Six Days Enduro will be held on demanding terrain in Portugal. No chain is stronger than its weakest link, so no compromise can be made for those intent on crossing the finish line. KTM, once again, rises to the challenge with the latest, limited Six Days edition of extra-tough machines. Easily identified by their special Six Days design, these bikes feature an extended list of top-of-the-line components, all specially designed and refined by KTM's own research and development department. These are the ultimate Enduro bikes for the exceptional event.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
KTM sets the benchmark in technology with its vast range of race-winning offroad competition 2-stroke models. Two years after the introduction of the world's first 2-stroke electronically controlled fuel injection offroad models, the success story continues with completely reworked, new generation offroad competition engines, all fitted with the revolutionary TPI system. This further demonstrates KTM's unrelenting commitment to 2-stroke advancement. The benefits are clear: besides huge improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions, the system also removes the need for pre-mixing fuel and re-jetting, meaning that with less effort, the engine always runs smoothly and crisply.
CHASSIS
When it comes to 2-stroke weaponry, keeping weight down is key. It should come as no surprise then that the KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS is one of the lightest, slimmest and most agile enduro machines in its class.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Designed for complete harmony between rider and bike, KTM has exploited the knowledge from decades of race success to create perfect ergonomics on the KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS. Maximum rider comfort and movement in all conditions is guaranteed. Additionally, the bike features a new tail light design which fits perfectly to the new shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Drawing on input from KTM's factory riders, as well as KTM R&D and Kiska Design, the bodywork of the KTM 250 XC-W TPI SIXDAYS pushes the boundaries of progression to the extreme. The result is a shape that achieves complete harmony between rider and bike. The main goal was to provide the optimal contact points that allow a rider maximum freedom of movement and improved handling. The front and rear fenders feature an intelligent I-beam design, guaranteeing maximum stability with the lowest possible weight. The tail light design fits perfectly to the shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier. Additionally, the SIX DAYS edition features a very unique Portugal inlay Graphics design and a standout orange frame.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
KTM XC-W TPI models feature the most modern engine management system of any 2-stroke off-road motorcycle. By reading various sensor data inputs, such as intake and ambient air pressure, throttle valve position and water temperature, the control unit optimizes ignition timing and the amount of fuel to inject at all altitudes and conditions. The KTM 300 XC-W TPI SIX DAYS edition comes with a handlebar map select switch, which allows to select between a standard and advanced power curve.

NEW DAY, NEW ADVENTURES.
Humans have always wondered what lies over the horizon. First we walked. Then we had horses. And now we have the best exploration tool yet: the Honda Africa Twin. Even better news? Now there's a second option, celebrating the 30th anniversary of Honda's original Africa Twin: the new Africa Twin Adventure Sports. Same great engine, but optimized for riders looking for more range and comfort, on and off road. You get a bigger fuel tank, more suspension travel, a larger skid plate, wider footpegs, a larger windscreen, and more. So turn your next vacation into an adventure whether it's a weekend or a year off. Where will that take you? On a Honda Africa Twin, anywhere you want.Features may include:
PARALLEL-TWIN ENGINE LAYOUT
The Africa Twin's parallel-twin engine layout makes the bike shorter front-to-back. That means the front wheel can tuck in closer to the engine, shortening wheelbase and making the bike more nimble off road and on pavement.
LONG TRAVEL SUSPENSION
The Africa Twin doesn't just look like an adventure bike it's the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel suspension. The fork features huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel, while the single-shock rear Pro-Link suspension is also fully adjustable, with 8.7 inches of travel and a convenient remote preload adjustment. Our Adventure Sports version offers 9.9 inches of travel up front and 9.4 inches of travel in the rear.
TRANSMISSION CHOICE
You pick: The Africa Twin and Africa Twin Adventure Sports are available with either our standard six-speed manual gearbox or Honda's exclusive automatic six-speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Both transmissions are excellent choices, and both feature stout, strong steel gears inside the only difference is who does the shifting.

2023 Honda Rebel 500 ABS SE
UNLEASH YOUR INNER REBEL
Rebels are the ones who refuse to compromise, just like the Rebel 500 refuses to choose between power, precision and style. It's able to deliver all three in excess, thanks to the timeless cruiser styling, a lean twin-cylinder engine and user-friendly powerband. While contemporary features like a full LED lighting package, our Honda slipper/assist clutch and optional anti-lock braking system make for an uncompromising ride down the straights as well as the twisties. New colors for this year will pair perfectly with your favorite gear or accessories, helping you personalize a modern cruiser that refuses to be ignored. Or check out the Rebel 500 ABS Special Edition for a model that comes complete with our most popular accessories, like the diamond-stitch seat and headlight cowl.
Features may include:STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one's not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone's lineup. It's comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
Developed and perfected in Honda racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It's technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the Rebel 500's engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus, it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.

She may be a 2022 VIN but she is all 2023!
2022 Husqvarna FC 250 Rockstar Edition
All new for 2022. The FC 250 Rockstar Edition is undoubtedly the best 250cc motocross machine ever built by Husqvarna Motorcycles. Multiple refinements and upgrades to the engine, suspension, and chassis create a faster and more agile machine. The finished product is a competition-ready, high performance racing motorcycle.
Features may include:
01. Finest Componentry
Exhaust system
Designed from lightweight aluminum, the exhaust system on the FC 250 Rockstar Edition features a flow-designed resonance chamber that is integrated into the header pipe. The silencer has a short and compact design, delivering impressive power output while keeping decibels as low as possible.
Factory wheel set
For unrivalled durability, the hubs used on the Factory Wheel Set are CNC-machined from forged aluminum then anodized black for a true race team look. The hubs are then laced to black D.I.D. DirtStar rims with high quality spokes to create a strong, lightweight wheel set. The reduction in unsprung weight contributes to improved overall handling.
02. Uncompromised Ability
Bodywork
Beneath the race team replica graphics, the new bodywork is designed to enhance unrestricted movements and allow riders of all abilities to perform at their very best for extended periods of time. Complete with a high grip GUTS Racing seat cover, superior control in all conditions is guaranteed.
Fork
Featuring a capsulated air spring and pressurized oil chamber, the new WP XACT 48 mm split air fork delivers incredible performance. With oil and air bypasses reducing pressure peaks, in combination with a mid-valve damping system the fork provides exceptional feedback and rider comfort. A new hydrostop system creates a more progressive damping force in the last 40 mm of travel for improved bottoming resistance.
03. Class-Leading Performance
Cylinder head
Optimal performance is guaranteed from the revised DOHC cylinder head thanks to the DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coated finger followers minimizing friction. These actuate the large titanium valves (32.5 mm intake, 27.5 mm exhaust) and introduce the fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber to create efficient, best-in-class power throughout the 14,000-rpm rev range. Further updates include new valve timings adapted to the new valve measurements, which work in perfect unison with the redesigned camshaft.

TUNE IN TO VICTORY
Class leading performance and suspension along with the smartphone power tuner app make this the bike of choice for race winners.
Features may include:ENGINE
New More Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder
The YZ450F's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design is now even lighter and more compact than before, ideally positioned in the frame for optimized weight distribution. Inside, the new head features steeper valve angles to allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port, as well as more aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint working together with a higher compression bridge-box design piston, DLC-coated piston pin, and longer connecting rod to give YZ450F riders the best balance of class leading power with an all new level of controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing track and weather conditions.
Electric Starter System
The YZ450F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Revised Bilateral Beam Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact aluminum frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Every aspect has been carefully retuned, with thinner main spar construction, thicker down tubes, revised top triple clamp, and all-new motor mounts that work together to optimize overall rigidity balance for excellent handling, especially in fast, bumpy conditions.
Compact Body and New Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. The new handlebar position is 5mm lower and 15mm forward and the seat features 10% firmer foam to assist the rider in keeping their weight forward during aggressive riding.
New Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The new top triple clamp design is resculpted to balance rigidity for improved steering feel, while the 4-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

Switch from road to off-road to rider programmable modes on the fly - and overcome the weather, the road and whatever nature can throw at you.
The Tiger 800 range offers three different Riding Modes that allow the adjustment of the throttle maps, ABS and TTC to suit different road conditions. Select either ROAD or OFF-ROAD mode and the throttle maps, ABS, and Triumph Traction Control are automatically set.
RIDER MODE allows you to configure these settings independently to suit your own personal riding style. In RIDER MODE, the throttle maps can be switched between RAIN, ROAD, SPORT, and OFF-ROAD settings.Traction Control
Every Tiger 800 features first-in-class standard fitment of Triumph Traction Control (TTC) that prevents the unexpected spinning of the rear wheel and cuts the engine torque to avoid the loss of lateral grip.
The XCX/XCA and XRX/XRT feature advanced Traction Control with three settings:
1. ROAD: optimised for road use, allowing minimal rear wheel slip
2. OFF ROAD: allows increased rear wheel slip
3. OFF: disables the traction control settingControls
The Tiger 800 models feature Cruise Control as standard, making long journeys more comfortable and helping fuel efficiency.ENGINE

It has been mildly upgraded with lowering links, jetted carb, air pump removal, larger gas tank, new rear rack, and a few other minor things. During my ownership I have kept up with service and put about 5k miles on the bike.

The front tire has less than 500 miles on it, the rear is about a year old. No issues, ride it home! Comes with a few spare parts.

Asking $4500, or would consider trade. Mainly interested in two stroke 200/250cc dirtbike, 1960s-70s Honda CL, or older touring bike (CB750/GS850/KZ750/etc). Only selling as I’m looking to get out of the dual sport game.",,gas,17207,manual,,,,,,,,,,

2023 Husqvarna® TX 300

Price: $11,199.00
Description:

2023 Husqvarna® TX 300
Pure agility
Receiving multiple technical upgrades for 2023, the TX 300 comfortably retains its place as the leading offroad 300cc 2-stroke on the market today. Housed inside an all-new frame that offers improved handling, a new, compact engine features an electronic exhaust control for enhanced power delivery in every gear. With the internal components positioned to further centralise rotating mass, the engine continues to play a vital role in the outstanding agility that the TX 300 is known for. Expertly assembled with premium and essential offroad components as standard, the versatile machine benefits from exceptional build quality for guaranteed performance and reliability. Movement on the motorcycle is made easier for 2023 thanks to the all-new bodywork, which is finished with a Swedish- inspired colour scheme for a truly distinctive look.
Features may include:
Faster and wiser
Engine
The new generation TX 300 engine is at the pinnacle of 2-stroke performance and weighs just 52.6 lb. Complete with the latest technical innovations for 2023, the TX 300 receives significant updates with Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) and electronic exhaust control reducing running costs, removing the need for jetting changes, and improving reliability. The result is a tailormade power delivery for each gear and every situation. The known E-Start adds to the simplicity of this popular model and guarantees fast starting in all conditions.
Cylinder
The cylinder features a 72 mm bore and an electronic exhaust control system. This highly innovative technology manages the opening of the lateral exhaust ports before the main exhaust ports open to deliver strong, controllable power. The upper contour of the exhaust port features a machined finish for improved port timing and unrivalled performance.
Ride easier
Polyamide-reinforced aluminium subframe
Made from 60% polyamide and 40% aluminium, the new two-piece subframe for 2023 ensures exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just 3.9 lb. The lower subframe spars and frame mounts are manufactured from cast aluminium for significantly improved reliability. The upper section of the subframe is made from injection-moulded polyamide to enable specific flex characteristics and ensure a lightweight construction.
Triple clamps
Matching the new frame design and suspension set-up, the CNC-machined triple clamps provide precisely calculated geometry for increased stability. Customised handlebar flex can be achieved by the new handlebar clamp which offers two mounting options - rubber-damped for less vibration or fixed for enhanced front-end feedback. The upper triple clamp is stiffer to ensure a smoother fork action and plays a vital role in the perfect alignment of the front wheel for superior handling.
Effortless ergonomics
Bodywork
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at their best for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points have been repositioned for 2023 and together with a flatter seat profile, riders can move freely on the motorcycle for total control at all times.

You like extreme and long tours? On rough roads, over stony tracks out in the wild, too? Tarmac, offroad, stones and sand: These are the challenges the new BMW R1200GS Adventure is longing to master with its easy and agile handling. A machine for those who want to test their limits and go beyond them. Or to put it briefly: A motorcycle for riders who are seeking real adventure and don't want to miss out on a great deal of riding pleasure in the process.

Conquer any type of terrain on an adventure bike that meets all your practical needs. Two standard-fitted ride modes – ""Rain"" and ""Road"" – are available at the press of a button and offer two completely different, finely tuned riding experiences. It's like having two motorcycles in one. Further riding modes are also available as an option. 7.9 gallons in the fuel tank combined with the engine's optimized fuel efficiency really make you ""unstoppable"" on and off the road making unwanted stops a thing of the past. In addition the standard level of equipment was improved, e.g. to include an on-board computer. This enables perfect navigation and provides the rider with useful data such as fuel level, average speed and fuel consumption. This travel adventure machine is rounded off by a newly integrated compartment above the tank which allows you to keep small items within reach at all times.

The R 1200 GS Adventure responds dynamically in any situation thanks to the legendary 92 lb-ft of flat-twin torque and 125 bhp delivered by the new, air/liquid-cooled 2-cylinder 4-stroke engine.

The R 1200 GS is also characterized by its unmistakable design, further improved seating comfort, wind and weather protection and by its muscular presence.

The R 1200 GS Adventure. Make an impression. Everywhere.

Never-ending riding fun.
A motorcycle that defined the classic touring bike segment has now reached the next stage of evolution: the new BMW R 1200 RT. With its light handling, the R 1200 RT makes it possible to enjoy what is most important: riding through the landscape. Whether on your own or with a passenger: the new R 1200 RT is all about comfortable, relaxed riding on every tour.

More dynamic performance. More control.
The new RT has a new air/water-cooled BMW boxer engine with even more torque and 125 bhp. Thanks to the traction control system ASC, the machine offers stability on every country road. The standard ride modes ""Rain"" and ""Road"" can also be activated at the press of a button, adapting the motorcycle perfectly to the weather conditions and road surface as required. The On Board Computer Pro and the familiar heated grips round off the range of basic equipment.

More optional extras. More comfort.
The special equipment for the new RT offers an increased level of comfort for the best motorcycling experience. For example, the semi-active electronic suspension adjustment BMW Dynamic ESA responds within a fraction of a second to changing road surfaces. Shift Assistant Pro allows the rider to shift up and down without using the clutch or throttle. Another option available is ""Dynamic"" mode, which guarantees maximum riding fun for sporty, dynamic motorcyclists. Also available as an optional extra: a central locking system which also locks both cases by remote control, a cruise control system and lots more.

More design. More impressions.
A supreme touring bike with a persuasive design: the use of transparent materials conveys lightness and agility.

Touring all inclusive: the K 1600 GTL Exclusive.
When dynamic performance meets luxury, the result is always exclusive and sensational. BMW Motorrad presents the K 1600 GTL Exclusive – a high-class touring bike that takes technology and visual styling to the extreme. This GTL makes all 6-cylinder dreams come true.

The design: a perfectly crafted masterpiece.
""Exclusive"" at first sight: three layers of paint give the outer skin of the GTL Exclusive a level of quality and depth which is unparalleled. Mineral white metallic is seamlessly blended with gentle Magnesium metallic matte and supplemented with numerous surfaces finished in chrome, seats and upholstery in Magnesium silver and a wealth of other details – the GTL Exclusive radiates luxury and dynamic performance from every angle.

The technology: only the best.
The GTL Exclusive also features the silken-soft yet powerful in-line 6-cylinder. Its exclusivity lies in the detail: Hill Start Control for moving off effortlessly on slopes, Keyless Ride automatically releases the steering lock, ignition, fuel tank lid and alarm system as soon as the key is within two meters of the motorcycle. The radio foil aerial antenna is integrated invisibly in the body and the Adaptive headlight with xenon technology enhances visibility and safety.

The equipment: uncompromising.
The equipment options assembled for the GTL Exclusive are those most frequently in demand among motorcyclists. Central locking with alarm system and a heatable seat with backrest come as standard.

THE VERY FINEST SPORT TOURING.
Riding dynamics coupled with touring suitability - at the very highest level: that's the R 1200 RS. With its potent engine and stable suspension, the sports touring bike offers more than just a huge amount of riding pleasure. Thanks to its relaxed, sporty seating position and its perfect wind and weather protection, the bike offers an incredible ride feel when traveling fast and riding along country roads in sporty style.

Performance meets design.
The concept of a modern, dynamic blend of sport and touring characteristics is demonstrated visually by means of a half fairing featuring symmetrical headlamps derived from two generations of the RR. The elegantly shaped handlebar unit with attached forged aluminum section perfectly combines function and ergonomics.

Dynamic unleashing of power.
The sports touring bike derives its supreme power from an output of 125 hp (92 kW) delivered by an air/liquid-cooled 2-cylinder 4-stroke boxer engine with two overhead spur gear driven camshafts and a counterbalance shaft. In order to ensure stability on every country road, ASC (Automatic Stability Control) is featured as standard. Engine modes ""Rain"" and ""Road"" - likewise standard - provide an optimum riding experience.

Equipment and accessories add the perfect finishing touch.
The extensive range of factory option equipment goes from case holders and luggage rack to cruise control and the convenient ""Keyless Ride"". With the system case and the practical topcase, the sporty tourer is perfectly rounded off: harmonized with the ergonomics and integrated in the motorcycle's overall look as always, they offer a level of travel comfort you would not normally expect of a sports tourer.


The special equipment Ride Modes Pro mainly contain two extra riding modes as well as ABS Pro.

WITH EVEN MORE DRIVE FOR ADVENTURE.

The new BMW R 1250 GS: concentrated performance meets impressive efficiency. With the new BMW R 1250 GS you will experience the new Boxer even more directly. An increase in engine displacement brings you even more performance – pumping out 136 hp and 105 lb-ft of torque. BMW ShiftCam variable camshaft control system ensures consistent power delivery – throughout the entire power band. Whether in the city, on the motorway, or off road, every mile gives you more freedom and riding pleasure. New styles and colors, numerous technical details, and exciting individualization options combine to bring you the new BMW R 1250 GS.

Performance, efficiency, control.
The twin-cylinder Boxer engine of the new R 1250 GS fascinates in its diversity right from the very first moment. Its character is unmistakable – whatever the ride. It offers you increased performance and smooth running at low speeds at the same time. The BMW ShiftCam variable camshaft control system ensures greater torque across the entire power band, providing greater control in every riding situation, giving you power whenever you need it. More power, more torque – and increased fuel efficiency. The strong performance with fewer gear changes gives you more control.

Dynamic Brake Control.
Available DBC supports you in emergency braking by counteracting involuntary throttle actuation in challenging riding scenarios. The system intervenes to reduce engine torque, and increase braking force. The result is more safety through the best possible use of the braking capacity to stabilize your bike and shorten the stopping distance.

Features may include:
Connectivity with high-resolution color display in series.
Connect your smartphone to your bike via Bluetooth. The 6.5-inch TFT display provides extensive information about your motorcycle and offers additional features such as navigation, music, and connectivity via your smart phone.

Next-Gen Dynamic ESA.
Available Next-Gen Dynamic ESA ensures more stable and therefore even safer ride characteristics. The system automatically regulates the damping and spring preload of the struts depending on riding conditions and load of your bike, and offers the highest level of comfort and traction on a wide variety of surfaces, when cornering.

Ride Modes Pro as an option with new features.
Ride Modes Pro adds ABS Pro, Enduro ABS, DTC, Dynamic Mode, Dynamic, Pro Mode, Enduro Mode, and Enduro Pro Mode as well as these additional new features: Hill Start Control Pro with selectable automatic brake activation on hills and Dynamic Brake Control.

Even more expressive.
The Exclusive Style Package combines Black Storm Metallic with Night Black Matte paint. A black powertrain and handlebars, grey frame and gold colored brake calipers round off the stylish appearance.

BMW ShiftCam.
The ShiftCam lettering: a clear indication of the new Boxer engine with variable camshaft control.

Improved off-road capability.
The HP Style Package includes front-wheel cover extension, radiator protection, frame protection, gold cross spoke wheels, rally seat, and rally windshield – as well as BMW Motorsport colors.

As fast as lightning
The Aprilia Tuono V4 Factory is a veritable performance machine, with new lines, new aerodynamics with integrated winglets, a Moto GP-style swingarm, advanced electronics and 175 mighty horsepower all making it a standout both on the road and on the track.

Developed on the track, but always ready for the road
The Tuono V4 Factory leaves you in little doubt that it is all about thrills, adrenalin and pure unadulterated fun. Designed for the most demanding riders, who aren’t shy about hitting the track, it comes a standard component that is anything but standard, in the form of Öhlins Smart EC 2.0 semi-active suspension.

Technology
Power and electronic controls for impeccable performance
Powered by a four-cylinder 65° V engine with unique characteristics, the narrow V architecture delivers improved weight distribution and allows for a more contained chassis. The maximum power of 175 horsepower at 11350 rpm and top torque of 121 Nm at 9000 rpm conform with Euro 5 requirements, further boosted by a new, lightweight exhaust. Also new is the Magneti Marelli 11MP ECU, with its data calculation capacity to create sophisticated algorithms for improved power and performance.

Chassis
Racing stability and agility
The chassis, already recognised as a benchmark in efficiency and feeling, is further improved with the addition of a new lightweight aluminium swingarm with a lower reinforced brace. Designed to lower masses and increase stability, it was tested on Aprilia bikes that dominated the World SBK and further developed with MotoGP in mind.

Sophisticated electronics
The famed Aprilia control package is more comprehensive than ever with the introduction of adjustable engine braking and a total of six Riding Modes, three each for both road and track. All the rider has to do is select their preferred setting and functions including Traction Control, Wheelie Control, engine brake and ABS among others, are automatically calibrated to deliver the perfect riding experience.

Improved ergonomics, more enjoyable riding
The new design puts the focus on ergonomics with a new fuel tank, and the seat lowered by 9 mm, increasing spaciousness and creating a more comfortable fit with the fairing and a more natural and relaxed riding position, even for taller riders.

Daytime Running Lights
Distinctive design features include reduced surfaces and the typical fairing, which now houses a new triple configuration of LED lights and DRLs with the “bending lights” function.

This beautiful pearl white Ninja 300 ABS is in fantastic condition with low miles. This is a perfect choice for a new rider looking for a lightweight sport bike.

The Kawasaki Ninja 300 utilizes a parallel twin 296cc motor that makes smooth, expectable power. This gives the operator of the motorcycle both a confidence inspiring and thrilling riding experience. It is lightweight and has a low seat height (30.9 inches), again giving the rider a sense of confidence balancing and maneuvering the bike.

Enjoy the added safety and piece of mind from the ABS braking system.

This specific motorcycle had one previous owner who had all services performed at the dealership including an oil change service just 100 miles prior.

It has frame sliders installed as well as Tech Spec tank side grips, both nice upgrades.

This is a nice one, don't hesitate--reserve it today

2022 CFMOTO PAPIO 125
$2,999.99*
Description The stylish Papio is a special breed of motorcycle designed for, well, everyone. And it's affordable, so you can easily spring for a his and hers. The single-cylinder, air-cooled engine needs only 126cc to whisk you into a whole new world of fun. On top of that, it's practical and easy to maintain. Just put in a little gas and ride. This little beauty turns your basic, garden-variety errand into a great escape. People will stare. Many will smile. Some will even wave. The rest will wonder why they don't have a couple of Papios in their garage.
Features Great Riding Stability: Benefitted from large disc brakes (210mm) and a top-tier suspension system, the bike's front, and rear shock absorbers react sensitively to road conditions. New Generation Engine and Outstanding Handling: With a completely upgraded engine and fine-tuned EFI system, the new Papio recognizes lower engine rpm in maximum torque, allowing it to increase the speed at a faster rate. Advanced Safety: Compared to older models, the Papio's newly developed tires add width, which provides advanced grip and driving stability for ultimate safety and fun. Single-Cylinder Air-Cooled Engine: The 126cc single-cylinder engine with Bosch® EFI wins the most efficient in-town commuter award. The air-cooled engine is simple, lightweight, and reliable. Euro Styling: It's your city runabout. It's your daily commuter. And with its modern Euro design, you're sure to arrive in style wherever you go. Disc Brakes: Disc brakes bring the Papio to a rapid, controlled stop. Chalk it up to the large front rotor sporting a two-piston floating caliper and the rear disc with its single piston floating caliper. Suspension: Small means fun, nimble, and easy to ride. A well-designed frame and great suspension help. Check out the telescopic front fork with 109mm of travel and the 5-click preload adjustable monoshock. 6-Speed Transmission: Power is fed to the rear wheel via a fun-to-shift six-speed tranny. It's ideal for the city commuter who wants to zip around without any fuss. Loaded with Extras: A digital LCD display and LED lights add to the list of features that make the Papio one of the best-equipped and lowest-priced mini bikes on the market. Engine

2011 DR650SE,https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/mcy/d/issaquah-2011-dr650se/7573234261.html,7573234261,"$4,200","I went down and got this bike in Portland in June, as a plane-jane stocker with new plastics. I transferred all the adventure bike parts from my first DR onto it, just as the snow melted late in the riding season.

The bike had an active season, with many dual sport day rides, and a few adventure rides camping with full gear, and it performed flawlessly.

It wore out two back tires, and logged 7K stress-free miles for me in 2022.

I have it set up with sprockets for long-distance road travel, so it cruises at 75mph @ 5500rpm's. I'll swap the sprockets for the right buyer, because it no longer flows through hairpin corners in second gear on the gravel.

Bike gets 45 mpg, has a range of 200 miles. It's pretty much pampered, tricked out, already fixed up, and ready to go. It likes to keep up with the big KTM adventure bikes. It can do everything they do, except go interstate at 90 mph.

It's a good, steady bike. Serous offers only, no thanks in advance to any low-ballers. We can discuss another price without the hard bags and winsheld in person.

IRON 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look. Now with fresh, new graphics.
TEAR UP THE NEAREST STREETS WITH RAW CUSTOM STYLE
Blacked-Out Look
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Tuck and Roll Seat
A solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

If you want to place a hold on a pre-owned bikes, you can do so right on our website. 

YouTube - https://youtu.be/iENCnYu-PfI

This 2015 Ducati 1299 S Panigale arrived last week, we sold it to its current owner in late 2021.  At that time it only had just over 2900 miles, and we had just performed an annual service before it went up for sale.   When it arrived for consignment we asked our service techs to give it a quick inspection and install a fresh set of Pirelli Diablo Rosso IV tires, and a quick hydraulic system flush.  It didn't need much, last thing was a good detail.  This Panigale 1299 S has zero stories to tell, always cared for and maintained, no signs of abuse or neglect.   It comes with a rear seat cover, owners manual, service records, all keys and a verified clean WA title.

PRESS

Ducati continues to push the envelope in the superbike category with the release of the 2015 1299 Panigale. This machine was built to succeed the 1199, and it boasts several improvements over its predecessor, not the least of which is the 10-percent increase in power up to a whopping total of 205 horsepower! It almost beggars belief that one could squeeze that many horses out of a two-cylinder engine, and it really speaks to the innovative engineering hidden behind the fairings. Sophisticated electronics tame the engine, brakes and suspension, and transform the bike from new-user friendly to race-ready at the touch of a button.  True to its roots, the overall appearance shows its DNA, but with subtle differences. The front fairing is a bit wider than on the 1199 and the windshield offers better protection. While these changes make the bike a bit bigger, the Panigale actually enjoys an increase in air penetration.   A full TFT screen displays the instrumentation in full color, and it controls the various systems and settings “for the Riding Mode” function, which for me is the pièce de résistance for the whole bike.  This feature allows you to fine tune the performance of the engine, suspension and brakes through a number of factory and custom presets to quickly configure the bike for the conditions that you are expecting, be it a wet ride to town or hitting a closed-circuit racetrack. Ordinarily, most riders would be intimidated by a bike this powerful, and they should be, but the “Total Rider Control” system makes this bike as fierce or tame as you like (within reason).

All the maintenance has been performed in the last year. Brake fluid has been changed, coolant has been changed, engine oil has been changed, transmission oil changed, spark plug replaced. This runs, starts, rides and brakes perfectly. This is a very stable and easy to ride bike. It also has great gas mileage. I have the title and it is ready to ride.
Here are the less than perfect items. There is only one key (so don't lose it), it tipped over at one point and caused scratches and chipped plastic on the right side. I have pictures to show the damage. THAT'S IT!!! The speedometer and odometer are reading in KM. The ad reads 10,477 miles on the odometer AFTER the conversion of KM to Miles.

2022 VOLCON EPOWERSPORTS GRUNT
The Grunt is an innovative, easy-to-operate electric motorcycle that allows people to experience outdoor adventure or get work done in an efficient and fun way. With no gears, no clutch, no gas and no noise the Grunt is easy to ride and enjoy by off-road-enthusiast families, or those completely new to two wheels. Its torquey motor and innovative chassis lets it tackle the toughest terrain and conditions with ease. Work or play in a whole new way with the Volcon Grunt.
Features may include:
Motor & Battery
The Grunt’s unique Volcon motor is designed for torque and efficiency. But while the 60-volt power plant can handle any terrain, the adjustable ride modes make it easy to ride and extremely versatile. The motor and battery are IP67 rated so the motorcycle is ready to tackle any weather. Because off-road speeds are low and trail riding taps into regenerative braking often, the Grunt’s range is amazing. But if you need more, the Grunt’s batteries are swappable and a spare can be carried inside the frame for a quick doubling of range.
Chassis
The Grunt features Volcon’s unique Exo-Arch frame design. The triple-cradle frame and cast-aluminum swingarm are nearly indestructible. This is not a tall, tippy motocross bike, though. The Grunt’s low seat height makes it easy to maneuver with riders of all heights. The oversize tires add to the suspension’s smooth ride, and they float over surfaces like sand, mud and snow that swallow normal dirt-bike rubber. Tapered aluminum handlebars, a hand-stitched seat and mobile-phone-based ride control app deliver a premium cockpit for the rider to deliver adventures no other outdoor recreational vehicles can provide.
Low seat height
High torque motor
Off-road use only
Up to 75 miles range (with additional battery)
Three ride modes plus reverse
App based navigation, vehicle controls, and community

Dream Wilder

Exploration. Fun. Performance. And a great desire to take and leave towards the horizon. The identity of this bike leaves no room for doubt: just looking at it, it brings you into the atmosphere of Dakar racing.

DesertX is the first modern Ducati with 21 ""front wheel and 18"" rear, long stroke suspension and a new frame designed specifically for the off-road experience. 



Off-road chassis

21 ”front and 18” rear wheels, long stroke suspension, generous ground clearance (250mm) and an off-road frame designed and tested to withstand the toughest conditions.



Ergonomics optimized for every condition

Ergonomics and aerodynamic study give life to a motorcycle that has off-road as a natural territory and at the same time remains comfortable, easy and safe for urban commuting and long travels.



Advanced electronics, dedicated to versatility

The versatility of DesertX is also reflected in the Riding Modes: there's 6 of them, with Enduro and Rally dedicated specifically to the off-road riding experience.



Lightweight engine tuned for off-road use

DesertX is equipped with the latest evolution of the 937 cc Testastretta 11th desmo, lighter by 1.7 kg compared to the previous generation and equipped with a new gear ratio to ensure the best off-road behavior.



Post-heritage and digital

DesertX presented a completely new challenge to the Centro Stile. The opportunity to experiment with a new design language, seeking inspiration in the history of African Rally.

The result is a solid, clean, modern design, based on shapes taken from the most adventurous off-road world. It is a bike that wants to be solid and functional at the same time. 



Post-heritage minimal

The aesthetic of DesertX manages to combine the suggestion of the ""Dakarians"" with an almost touch interface feeling. It is post-heritage and digital at the same time



Essential and robust

The bike is visually composed of 3 macro elements: a single central volume, the saddle and the windshield that integrates the double headlight. A “Robust Design” effect that combines form and function.



Designed for comfort

The surfaces in contact with the rider are wide and well connected, allowing movement in various directions with the highest level of comfort, especially in off-road riding.



Technology for the adventure of a lifetime

We worked by drawing on the best of our knowledge in terms of ergonomics, engine, aerodynamics and electronics. And we developed a new specific chassis for off-road.

DesertX is functional, a 'sport tool', competent, technologically advanced and effective like all Ducatis. 



Chassis

DesertX was developed for the most demanding off-road, and therefore has all the essential contents for this type of use: spoked wheels, 21'' at the front and 18'' at the rear and generous ground clearance. Thanks to the various homologations obtained, DesertX has various types of tires available, up to those dedicated to the off-road world. 


21""/18"" wheel
combination

DesertX is equipped with the iconic wheel combination for the enduro segment: spoked wheels, 21'' at the front and 18'' at the rear. Ready to easily tackle any type of obstacle and asphalt.


Generous ground clearance 250 mm

A fundamental feature for off-road use, DesertX has a ground clearance of 250 mm, which is particularly favorable for more extreme off-road riding.


Wide choice of tires

The DesertX is equipped with Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR tubeless tires that combine greater reliability and safety in case of puncture with easier repair. Thanks to the different approvals obtained, there is a wide choice of alternative tires.


Kayaba long stroke suspension

The 46mm upside-down fork and fully adjustable single shock absorber were developed with the Japanese brand Kayaba, a successful producer in the off-road world.



Engine

The new DesertX is equipped with the latest evolution of the water-cooled 937 cc Desmodromic 11° Testastretta engine with 110 horsepower and 92 Nm of torque.

It’s the well-known twin cylinder already appreciated on our other models for its double soul: very manageable and smooth at low revs, but with a torque that is always ready and able to release all the Ducati character with a great extension. 



1.7 kg lighter

The new version of the Testastretta 11 ° introduces important improvements over the previous generation, which have led to an overall weight saving of 1.7 kg.



Reliable in different uses

Reliable and also designed for touring use, the engine has very long maintenance intervals, with oil change every 15,000 km and valve clearance check every 30,000 km.



Wide gear ratio

The work on the DesertX gearshift also involved the ratios, which were shortened overall for greater efficiency at high speed.



Riding mode

The versatility of DesertX is also reflected in the Riding modes: up to six options, two of which are specifically dedicated to the off-road riding experience.



Riding assistance systems

The electronic equipment is completed by the package of riding assistance systems: Traction control, Wheelie control, Engine brake control, cornering ABS, Quickshifter up & down and Cruise control, to make riding on long journeys even more relaxing.



Lighting system

The bike’s completely Full LED lighting system equipment is of the highest level. The double front headlight has two bi-function polyellipsoidal modules with Daytime Running Light (DRL) and has been designed to ensure excellent visibility, which is particularly important for a bike that can ride in all conditions. The rear headlight is equipped with the Ducati Brake Light. The system, in the event of sudden braking, automatically activates the flashing of the rear light to signal the condition of sudden slowing to following vehicles, making a further contribution to rider safety.



TFT & Connectivity

DesertX is equipped with a high resolution 5 ”color TFT display oriented vertically and positioned to offer the best visibility even in standing riding.

Heated seat and grips, cruise control, hot switches, and plenty of rider mode customizations just to name a few. Pure raw fun of a motorcycle. Low miles, recently serviced garage kept, never down.

Reach me by calling or texting: 5zero9 8five9 1489.

This is a 400S (dual-sport), not a 400SM (supermoto).

I bought this in the middle of June 2019. The bike had 26k miles but looked really clean and well maintained. The two previous owners kept hand-written records of everything they did to the bike. Had the bike running pretty well through the summer as a daily commuter to the train station and weekend adventure riding. I rode this thing everywhere and it was so much fun.

Has a new battery and new tires. Comes with tons of original parts. I added some detachable blinker lights because I kept breaking them on the trails. Added a low-profile taillight with a better license plate mount. There is a toolkit attached to the bike that is completely original. Comes with an extra-large gas tank.

Selling for $5000 or best offer.

This beautiful 2022 Suzuki SV650 is in Pristine condition with premium upgrades. It has a Yoshimura Alpha slip on exhaust and fender eliminator kit installed. This would be a perfect choice for a new or experienced rider looking for a well set up naked sport bike.

The legendary Suzuki SV650 is powered by a 645cc L-twin motor that makes 75 peak horsepower and tons of low end torque. The power delivery is smooth and expectable; great for riders of all experience levels.

The upright riding position offers a comfortable ride and the low 30.9 inch seat height make this bike easy to balance and maneuver.

This specific bike had one previous owner. It recently had its break in service performed at 1000 miles at Tacoma Motorsports.

The stock exhaust has been replaced with a very nice Yoshimura Alpha stainless steel slip on exhaust system as well as a Yoshimura fender eliminate kit--Both very tasteful upgrades.

Both original keys are included as well as the stock exhaust system, optional Yoshumura DB killer insert, and stock rear fender.

This bike is much better than new! Look at the pictures! Reserve this bike today!

Prefer a limited or dark horse but will consider the standard models. Be reasonable with the price. I’m not looking to steal it but maybe a fair off-season deal. Due to weather and job I can’t ride it for several months and it will continue to deprecate. I have some trips planned so I thought I would start looking. I’m in Springfield but will drive many hours for the right deal. Thanks and happy holidays!",,gas,1234,manual,,,,,,,,,,

Description
IRON 883™
An original icon of the Harley-Davidson Dark Custom style. It sets the standard for the raw, stripped-down, blacked-out look. Now with fresh, new graphics.
TEAR UP THE NEAREST STREETS WITH RAW CUSTOM STYLE
Blacked-Out Look
It’s the poster bike of the anti-chrome movement. You’ve got a black powder-coated 883cc engine with black rocker covers. Black on the throwback round air cleaner cover. Chopped fenders, to show off a little rubber and black front forks with gaiters to add a little old-school nostalgia.
Street Inspired Paint
We created paint jobs with colors that look right against the backdrop of the urban grid, and don’t need a lot of maintenance. These are tough finishes, as mean as the meanest street.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7-inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. The ride is responsive and plush, whether you're dodging urban potholes or out exploring the back roads.
Tuck and Roll Seat
A solo seat that combines modern comfort with an authentic “tuck and roll” design inspired by the early days of the bobber.
Machined 9-Spoke Wheels
Nine-spoke wheels that are black as night where the rim meets the rubber and set off by a more contemporary mechanical look machined into the spokes.
883cc Air-Cooled Evolution Engine
Authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through, dripping with power. The rubber-mounted 883cc Evolution engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of boulevards and back streets.
Drag-Style Handlebar
Born at the drag strip, the low-rise, slammed black drag-style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that puts you in a forward, aggressive riding position.

The bike wears black from top to bottom, except for contrasting orange-red accents on various components.

I absolutely love this bike, but I don't ride it very often. As you can see by the pictures, it is well taken care of and it has been garage kept since I have owned it.

* The bike is #607 out of 1600 made (see pic).
* Full service performed 2 years ago, and I put about 200 miles on it a year.
* After each ride, it is wiped down.
* The saddle bags are original and are mink oiled twice a year.
* Mileage is 27,671 (not bad for a 30 year old bike).
* Never laid down by me and no obvious signs of a major lay down. It does have some scruff marks on the muffler.
* There are NONE available in the US on cyletrader.com (ie collector's bike).
* Extra seat and extra back rest.
* Have motorcycle cover.
* Have motorcycle chocks.
* I have original paperwork, including the original maintenance manual.

• Replica of the first modern motorcycle

In 1885, German inventor Gottlieb Daimler, whose name would later become inextricably linked with that of Benz, demonstrated his prototype high-speed internal combustion engine installed in a rudimentary two-wheeler: the modern motorcycle had been born. Daimler and his collaborator Wilhelm Maybach had both worked for the Deutz engine company, helping to develop a successful four-stroke stationary engine powered by mains-supplied coal gas. Daimler though, could see the potential of such an engine as a means of propulsion, providing it could be developed to run on an alternative fuel. Fortunately, there was one readily available: benzine (petrol), which hitherto had been used mainly as a cleaning fluid for clothing.

The first Daimler engine was an air-cooled single displacing 264cc, featuring an 'atmospheric' inlet valve and a mechanically operated side exhaust valve, an arrangement known as 'IOE'. It was capable at running at an unprecedented 750rpm, and produced around half of one horsepower. Other noteworthy features included a float carburetor (developed by Maybach), 'hot tube' ignition, and fan cooling, the cylinder barrel being devoid of fins.

The engine was installed in a home-built, two-wheeled test-bed, as it was not yet powerful enough to propel the heavier four-wheeled vehicle that Daimler envisaged. His prototype employed a steel-reinforced timber frame bolted together, which carried the engine vertically between the wheels. The latter were iron-tired cart wheels, and the rider sat on a horse-type saddle on top of the frame. Belt drive was used, with a tensioning jockey wheel serving as a crude clutch. Controls were mounted on the handlebars.

Although called the 'einspur' (one track), Daimler's motorcycle was supported by 'stabilizer' wheels on either side, as the tall saddle meant that the rider's feet could not reach the ground. It is also known as the 'Reitwagen' (riding car). On 10th November 1885, Daimler's 17-year-old son Paul made history by completing the first journey by motorcycle when he rode the Reitwagen from his father's works in Canstatt to Unterturkheim and back, a distance of around 7.5 miles.

The Reitwagen was soon improved by adding a two-speed transmission, but it was only ever a means to an end and having served its purpose was left to gather dust in the workshop. When the latter burned down in 1903, this priceless relic was destroyed. • Replica of the first modern motorcycle

Sold on bill of sale
Gottlieb Damiler patented in 1885 what is generally recognized as the prototype of the modern gas engine.
This engine was installed in a two-wheeled wooden frame with two additional spring mounted outrigger wheels which were added for balance. They call it the Reitwagen or a two-wheeled riding carriage.
