Clean Title.

It‚Äôs been garage kept for the time that I have owned it. Just installed new bars and grips. Tires in good condition. Modified to fit ‚Äúcafe‚Äù style seat. Runs and rides great. It will drop from 2nd gear into a false neutral at high rpm‚Äôs. I have gotten used to going easy in 2nd, and is still plenty fast for me. The speedometer is missing (I‚Äôve used an app on my phone). Gear lever and front brake lever are bent but was never an issue for me. Mufflers we‚Äôre rotten so I straight piped it.

The CSC RX3 Adventure motorcycle is perfect for real-world riding, including adventure touring, off-road excursions, sightseeing, or commuting to work economically. The RX3 is equipped with a proven and smooth 250cc, 4-valve, overhead cam, counter-balanced engine. The engine is water-cooled and equipped with Delphi fuel injection and electric start. For maximum performance the bike features a six-speed transmission.

The RX3 engine has a proven record of economy and durability around the world. The engine is also specifically designed to be low-maintenance. This same engine is a best-seller in Central America (where motorcycle sales far exceed that of the U.S. annually.) The RX3 has competed and been proven in off-road rallies in Eastern Europe. This same dependable RX3 counter-balanced engine is also found in the RC3 factory Moto GP racing bike that has competed since 1999 and won the 2002 Motorcycle Endurance World Championship.

The CSC RX3 Adventure is outfitted with an equipment package that includes 80/20 dual sport tires on steel rims, a tall windscreen, adjustable front and rear suspension, Black rear panniers and top case, front and rear guards, steel engine skid plate, and much more that cost hundreds more on other bikes. Other adventure motorcycles force you to buy countless upgrades, but the RX3 includes a comfortable touring seat, passenger seat and foot pegs, LED turn signals and tail light, ABS brakes, a full digital dash with speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, gear indicator, neutral light, and clock plus an analog tachometer. These extra-cost options are all STANDARD equipment on the RX3.

But the CSC RX3 value continues with anodized front forks, wide steel foot pegs with removable rubber inserts, a stainless-steel exhaust, a 4.2-gallon gas tank with locking gas cap, a 300-watt alternator for accessories, 12 Volt charger , USB port and handlebar switches for these electrical accessories. You will pay hundreds more to add any of these options to any other adventure motorcycle ‚Äî if even possible - but ALL these features are STANDARD on the CSC RX3!

2021 Aprilia¬Æ Tuono 660
As powerful as thunder, as light as a cloud
Two universes collide... The legendary Tuona V4 1100 meets the advanced technology of the RS 660 to create the TUONO 660, a motorbike destined to shake up the way you look at the world.
Introducing the Tuono 660, the new generation of a versatile naked sportbike. Fun, easy and a heartbreaker on the aesthetics front, its potent combination of power and extraordinary lightness delivers a truly breathtaking and unique riding experience.
Features may include:Master of all roads
With five riding modes, of which three provide road options and two are designated for the track, there's plenty of choice for all riding styles and levels of rider, made even more enjoyable by the customisable and easy-to-use electronic instrument panel.Inimitable style
Choose from Concept Black, Iridium Grey and the rather special Acid Gold, until now only available on the RS 660, but already setting new standards of style and aesthetics in the motorycling world.Digital bells and whistles
The Tuono 660 sports advanced electronics that would put many superbikes to shame. The Ride-by-Wire throttle makes it a breeze to manage the APRC electronic system that includes multi-level traction control, anti-wheelie, cruise control, engine braking, ABS and engine mapping options.Daytime Running Lights
Upfront, the bike features triple LED headlights and daytime running lights, ensuring safer, more efficient riding whatever the time of day or night.Electrifying performance
The latest-generation fast and lightweight twin-cylinder forward-facing engine comes courtesy of the mighty Aprilia V4. Its 270-degree crank delivers a truly grunty exhaust note while the final ratios, which are shorter than those of the RS 660, favour rapid take off and response.
