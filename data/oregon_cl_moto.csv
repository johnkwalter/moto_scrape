2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.
Features may include:
ENGINE
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.
ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

2022 KTM 1290 Super Adventure S
Covering ground quickly and effortlessly is what the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S is made for. An Adventure-specced 1,301 cc V-Twin means that entire cross-country journeys are dispatched easily, while Adaptive Cruise Control and Semi-active Suspension together with reworked rider-focussed ergonomics and technology bring agility and long distance comfort to an entirely new level. It's a bold claim, but we'll make it - the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S is the new benchmark.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
With a sledgehammer hit of power and earth-twisting torque, the proven V-twin LC8 engine once again takes the accolades as the most compact, lightest, and best performing engine in the segment. Its greener too, and will deliver 15,000 km service intervals and low fuel consumption, trip after trip, mile after mile.
CHASSIS
Frame
A new, reworked, and lightweight, chrome-molybdenum stainless steel trellis frame featuring laser-cut tubes, combines with forged elements for an ultra-strong component on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S. The steering head has been moved 15 mm rearwards, to shorten the overall frame for improved cornering behavior, while the front engine mount has been rotated forward by 2 degrees to aid in hard acceleration, keeping the front end firmly planted on the ground. A newly designed, lightweight, and high-strength aluminum side stand completes the package.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
Wide, adjustable, and ready for long hours in the saddle, the high-strength tapered aluminum handlebars are designed to provide riders with greater control, and uncompromised comfort. Newly developed and robust handguards have also been designed for optimal aerodynamic behavior when it comes to high-speed stability.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
LED Headlight
Turning night into day, the new cornering integrated LED headlight has been designed to integrate the front Radar Sensor on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S, flanked by cornering and day time running lights. This results in a clean, KTM-distinctive look which provides impeccable illumination with a wide beam pattern to light up the road ahead.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Taking charge at the helm is an all-new scratch-resistant 7-inch TFT display. Unmatched in terms of graphics and readability, adventurers can access information and make adjustments to the bike's semi-active suspension on the fly, quickly and easily without navigating complex menus. This comes thanks to a 6-way switch cube on the handlebar. Connectivity is also taken care of by way of KTM MY RIDE, which connects via Bluetooth for turn-by-turn navigation, playing music, and even answering incoming calls. Still catching glare? The TFT screen is tilt-angle adjustable.

When responding using messenger send a phone number I can text or call you at. No scams, I will not send you a phony google code, so do not try it with me. Only legit people will be responded to, so lets keep this easy and fun!

1982 Harley Ironhead. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and realize this is a good opportunity.

Not looking to make any money, nor do I need money. I just need room for a collector car which is being shipped to me.

Runs, rides, starts, stops great. Oil pressure and gen light work properly so no hidden problems.

Headlight and taillight work perfect.

Turn signals and brake light not working, these bikes are as simple as they get, so fixing should not be a problem, if I get time I will dig into it myself.

A lot of what I know I will list to the best of my knowledge, most of it based on more than fifty years of owning collector cars and motorcycles.

Clear title, good tags. Engine number matches frame.

Miles unknown, but starts up with barely a crank and does not smoke at all, idles perfect.

Stock ironhead exhaust, worth a lot of in itself in this condition.

Speedo and tach work, but were obviously replaced at some point as mileage shows less than 200, impossible to have rolled over, so who knows when, what or why.

Original peanut style fuel tank replaced by a softail version, very common as the range was so low on the peanut tanks.

Harley tin and chrome all look great, not dents.

Tires have good tread and usable.

Brakes in good shape.

Kickstand has a repair job which could have been done better, but I am guessing the engine would have had to come out so it was a fix that works.

This is not a perfect bike, of course if it was price would be much higher. However, it is a vintage rideable Ironhead at a decent price. You can enjoy this bike and do the finishing touches without having to lose riding time.

That’s pretty much it, bring a helmet and ride it home.

Price is pretty firm, but everyone wants to see a better price no matter how great a deal, so here is what I will do. Bring cash, I am SLIGHTLY flexible. If you still think price is too high, show me a better deal for a similar bike in this area and we can talk.

I hope we can make a deal and be friends once it is done.

New spark plug
New tires & tubes

Fresh oil change

The carburetor was removed and ultrasonically cleaned and serviced and all of the electronics were gone through and cleaned up, repaired or replaced. She is in remarkable condition for her age. A few scratches here and there but everything is in great shape. The paint is original and does show some patina. The seat is in great shape, the cases and fork legs all look great and are still shiny. The pipe is rust free, as is the rest of the bike.

She’s a super nice vintage two stroke oil injected street bike that’s ready to roll around town! No mixing gas, ultra cheap insurance, 85mpg, lightweight, easy to ride and parts are still readily available as they made these bikes for 25+ years. Needs nothing but a new rider.

2022 KTM 200 Duke
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT
Thanks to an ultra-compact single-cylinder 4-stroke power plant and a lightweight tubular chassis, the KTM 200 DUKE packs a mighty punch. An updated predatory design proudly displays its BEAST-inspired DNA and shouts DUKE. Make no mistake - the KTM 200 DUKE is an out-and-out street prowling brawler.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Powered by a powerful single-cylinder engine, the KTM 200 DUKE not only delivers intoxicating acceleration but also everyday rideability. Boasting 19 kW (26 hp), it's the most powerful 4-stroke option in its class. Thanks to an updated airbox and exhaust, it meets the highest emission and noise standards, while providing maximum performance.
CHASSIS
Upside-down fork
The KTM 200 DUKE comes with ultra-lightweight, high-performance upside-down WP forks as standard. Using the latest technology, these forks not only perform flawlessly when pushed to the limit, but also allow riders to cruise comfortably on longer stretches of tarmac.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Seats
The two-part seat offers first class sport riding ergonomics with maximum support for both rider and pillion.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Design
There's no denying the KTM 200 DUKE is 100% DUKE. Its aggressive-looking headlight, READY TO RACE stance and sharp lines make it a formidable presence on any street.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
ABS
Single channel BOSCH ABS comes as standard on the KTM 200 DUKE. This means you can ride assured knowing that should you have to brake hard and suddenly - the DUKE has your back.

My first ""Z"" was a '72 Z1A900 so wanted to experience what a modern Z Kawasaki is like after 50 years of riding. I'm 64 years old and find the roads too dangerous to have fun so decided to do track days instead. I did 570 miles around Portland back roads, then 5 track days over 18 months. I have a personal policy: if it doesn't get ridden it must go. So 5 track days plus about 5 days of road-riding means it's been stored about 360 days/year. She's got to go to someone who'll ride her more often!

First service @ 600 miles, the second at 795 miles. All work since new by EDR Performance. EDR Performance de-restricted it, did airbox mods and reflashed ECU

Moto-Corsa Pre-Owned Manager's Special: Was $8799, NOW $7799! Pretty red 2018 Suzuki GSX-S750, naked version of the mighty GSX-R750 superbike, totally original with just over 1K miles , has some pitting on the fork lugs, top triple clamp, and passenger footpeg brackets but looks and runs great otherwise. * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2018 Suzuki GSX-S750
The new GSX-S750 brings significant engine and chassis advancements to firmly establish itself as the second model in Suzuki’s innovative lineup of performance street machines. The GSX-S750 features fresh, aggressive styling that encompasses the appearance of quality.
As with the GSX-S1000, this new GSX-S750 inherits its heart and soul from Suzuki’s MotoGP race experience and the 30-year heritage of the GSX-R750. With boosted engine power and a suite of rider-assist features, this restyled GSX-S750 is ready to capture hearts and turn heads as the new leader in its class.
This is the perfect sportbike response to the craving of today’s discriminating riders, this new GSX-S750 looks better and outperforms its popular predecessor – and other entries in the class. It is nimble, comfortable, and an exhilarating, fun ride.
Features may include:
New fuel-injected, 749cc, 4-cylinder engine uses GSX-R architecture to deliver a torque-rich sportbike experience.
Suzuki Advanced Traction Control* lets the rider select sensitivity to match road conditions.
The unique chassis integrates the best qualities of a tubular streetbike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame, and is fitted with KYB suspension to provide precise handling.
ENGINE
Potent 749cc 4-cylinder fuel-injected engine uses 2005 GSX-R750 architecture so the power delivery is an excellent bled of strong low-end and a muscular top end.
Using the K5 generation GSX-R engine architecture also permits a shorter chassis which greatly enhances handling. This also makes the GSX-S750 the only motorcycle in its class with an engine with SuperSport lineage.
Ventilation holes are added to the bottom side of each cylinder in the GSX-S750’s crankcase. The holes reduce pumping loss to help produce power and gain fuel economy.
TRANSMISSION
The race-proven six-speed close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine length.
The shorter final gear ratio enables the new GSX-S750 accelerate quicker than the prior model while the additional engine power maintains the same top speed potential.
Large diameter, wet multi-plate clutch is derived from a GSX-R750 design to easily transmit power while the rack and pinion clutch release provides the rider with superb friction-point feel.
CHASSIS
With styling influenced by the GSX-S1000, but with its own aggressive turn, the GSX-S750’s new bodywork looks wild and forceful, yet keeps the rider comfortable at all times.
The new headlight nacelle houses provides a visual focal point while the under cowl connects the chassis styling to the engine and new exhaust system.
Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular-style street bike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A reasonable sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests and seat.

2016 Ducati Multistrada 1200 Enduro Touring Package
Adventure Soul
The first Ducati designed to take you anywhere. Born to travel and to be unstoppable on any type of terrain, the Multistrada 1200 Enduro is able to stand up to the stresses and strains of off-road riding,but also on any road you can imagine. A real globetrotter, just like you.
Design and Technology
Design
The elegant and sporty design of the Multistrada has been given an all terrrain twist with the Enduro. The front is designed to integrate the new 30 litre tank. The front beak has been lengthened to better protect the rider from mud, in addition to the newly-designed front mudguard. The two side tank covers are created in anodised aluminium with visible screws. Looking at the bike in profile, you immediately note the upward curving line that starts from the swing-arm all the way to the front headlight, giving the impression that the Multistrada 1200 Enduro is an animal ready to pounce. The muscular but light shapes of the front marry with the lightweight rear end, designed to facilitate riding while standing.
Vehicle Hold Control
The ABS of the Multistrada 1200 Enduro is equipped with the Vehicle Hold Control system that, when activated, holds the braking of the bike when stopped. In this way, when making an uphill start or when fully loaded, you need only worry about regulating the clutch and accelerator, while the VHC will gradually reduce the pressure on the rear brake.
5'' TFT display
The new Multistrada 1200 Enduro is equipped with a 5"" Full-TFT display. The configuration of the display is variable and adapts automatically depending on changes in light and the selected Riding Mode, showing, in each case, the most useful data with which to manage the selected riding style. In addition, the display can be set up by the rider according to requirements.
Full LED lights
Ducati Cornering Lights (DCL) is a system designed to ensure greater active safety during night riding or when there is little light. On approaching a corner, the dedicated LED light positioned inside the headlights will light up in the direction of the road according to a set lean angle, ensuring better lateral visibility.
Ducati electronics
The Multistrada 1200 Enduro is equipped with all the Ducati technology you can imagine. Cornering ABS controls braking, maximising safety even when the bike is leaning; DucatiTraction Control regulates rear wheel sliding. And that’s not all: the Ride By Wire system, Ducati Wheelie Control, semi-active Ducati Skyhook Suspension (DSS) Evolution. Attention is also paid to comfort: Cruise Control, Hands-Free ignition and back-lit handlebar switches greatly enhance the riding experience.

2018 Ducati 959 Panigale Corse
DNA Racing
The 959 Panigale Corse represents the highest sporting expression of the famous twin cylinder from Borgo Panigale. Thanks to the Öhlins suspensions, the lithium-ion battery and a dedicated livery inspired by the MotoGP colours, the 959 Panigale Corse is ready to hit the track.
Superbike Essence
The track as a test bench, the stopwatch as an indisputable judge. For us victories and pole positions mean only one thing: the ability to build increasingly better street bikes. Because in Borgo Panigale competition and mass production are so close that they coexist. Technology, materials, innovative - and sometimes ""visionary"" - ideas give rise to unique motorcycles. Like the 959 Panigale, which incorporates the DNA and spirit of winning Superbikes to a practical level never seen before.
Features may include:
CONCEPT
Perfect balance
Power and lightness. Performance and control. The 959 Panigale achieves the perfect balance of these elements. The power of the 955 cc twin cylinder Superquadro and the exclusive monocoque frame create a unique mix of performance and ease of riding. Lightweight, easy to handle and controllable thanks to the technical equipment like the Brembo monobloc brakes with Bosch ABS, the slipper clutch, the advanced and adjustable suspensions and all the control and management electronics.
DESIGN
Symbiosis of technique and design
Born from a tradition that has seen many Ducati models win the most important design awards, including the prestigious Compasso d'Oro, the Panigale family has always been an example of style. The LED light emits an immediately recognisable light signature, the headlight fairing optimises the aerodynamic protection and airflow to the engine, while the tail guard split in two parts makes the back even more aggressive.
ENGINE
The Superquadro engine
The twin-cylinder Superquadro on the 959 Panigale is an integral part of the chassis as well as being the desmodromic heart of the bike. 157 hp at 10,500 rpm and a torque of 107.4 Nm at 9,000 rpm are numbers worthy of a Superbike, which on the 959 Panigale are managed not only by an advanced chassis but also by a top-of-the-line technical package.
TECNOLOGY
Performance, agility and control
The 955 Panigale uses all the Ducati technology to provide a perfect blend of racing performance and safety and comfort on the road. The standard motorcycle features the Bosch ABS 9MP, the two-channel latest-generation system that provides combined braking with anti lift-up function for the rear wheel so as to guarantee not only a reduced stopping distance, but also greater stability under braking

2015 Ducati Multistrada 1200 S Touring Pkg Red
Go everywhere
The new Multistrada 1200 S takes riding beyond all the barriers of compromise. Nothing stands in your way. Unbeatable on tarmac, perfect and comfortable for long-distance travelling, fun off the road and agile through town. Thanks to the new Ducati Testastretta DVT engine, cutting-edge Ducati Skyhook Suspension (DSS) Evo and refined electronics, there are no limits to the versatility of this true multibike. Just get on and head where you want.
Features may include:
Ducati Testastretta DVT
The new Multistrada 1200 is powered by the brand-new revolutionary Ducati Testastretta DVT engine which adopts a Desmodromic continuous variable valve timing to optimize power and torque across a wider rpm band delivering an unprecedented combination of breath-taking-torque (132 Nm@7.000 rpm), class-leading power (160 Hp@9.000 rpm) , super-smoothness and low fuel consumption; the Desmodromic Variable Timing (DVT) is a double and continuous system applied for the first time to a motorcycle engine managing both exhaust and intake camshafts.
Exhaust System
Both main manifolds end up straight into the single 3-chamber silencer, which acts as a 2-1-2 collector box and accommodates cat converter and sound-deadening material. The two compact, light aluminium alloy tail pipes exit the silencer and are positioned low to the side to keep noise and heat away from the passenger.
Independent Dual-Spark Configuration
The Ducati Testastretta DVT is equipped with two sparks whose ignition is managed independently: (1) one is placed at the center of the combustion chamber, the additional one (2) on the external side.
The benefit is to provide at any engine speeds a further more effective twin flame-front that ensures complete and efficient burning (quicker and more complete) of the fuel-air mixture within the combustion chamber across a shorter period of time.
At low engine speeds the two plugs work simultaneously, while at high engine speeds the two plugs are managed independently with a dedicated ignition timing.
Anti-knocking sensor
The Ducati Testastretta DVT features an integrated anti-knocking sensor; while optimized for high octane fuel (RON 95), thanks to an anti-knocking sensor the motor can also operate - without manual intervention - on lower octane normal fuel (RON 91) as are sometimes found in distant countries.
Superbike spec Brembo braking system
The Multistrada 1200 S features a Superbike spec Brembo braking system composed by racing oriented PR 16 brake pump managing two Ø 330 mm front discs coupled with Superbike-spec Brembo Monobloc M50 calipers. The rear performs with an huge single Æ 265 mm disc gripped by a single 2 x 28 floating Brembo caliper with sintered pads.
The performance of the brake system are supported by the 2 channels Bosh 9ME multi-calibrations ABS with cornering functionality that provides optimum braking even in bends.
Riding Mode
The new Multistrada 1200 incorporates the very latest innovative Ducati technologies, including the famous Ducati branded Riding Modes. The four Riding Modes (URBAN, TOURING, SPORT, ENDURO) are enabled by combining class-leading technologies such as: Ride-by-Wire (RbW), Ducati Traction Control (DTC), multi-calibration 9ME cornering ABS, Ducati Skyhook Suspension (DSS) Evo, Ducati Wheelie Control (DWC) and the graphics on the instrument panel. The rider can change the character of the bike by selecting from the left-hand switchgear - even while riding - among four different pre-set configurations (Riding Modes) that best adapt to the riding style or riding conditions.

2018 Ducati Panigale V4 S
A New Opera
It is called Panigale V4 and it marks a new and important chapter in Ducati's history, a ""symphony"" of performance and emotions that's 100% Italian. Panigale V4 is the first mass-produced Ducati motorcycle to be equipped with a 4-cylinder engine, closely derived from the Desmosedici of the MotoGP.
V4 revolution
The Panigale V4 replaces the iconic 1299 at the top of the Ducati supersport range, doing so by enhancing performance and ridability so that riders of all skill levels can enjoy boundless fun and excitement. The Panigale V4 has been developed in close collaboration with Ducati Corse, drawing directly on know-how and technology from the racing world to provide a road bike that is the closest thing possible to its MotoGP counterpart.
Features may include:
CONCEPT
A new paradigm
The new Panigale V4 is the essence of sport motorcycling in its most exhilarating and pure form: redefined design, new engine, state-of-the-art chassis and innovative electronics. A concentrated blend of Ducati technology, style and performance
DESIGN
The character has taken shape
Elegant, muscular, technological. This is the essence of the style of the new Panigale V4. The Ducati Style Centre gave shape to the character of the bike and its performance following what for Ducati are the canons of Italian sports elegance: large and soft surfaces interrupted by few bold marks. Component integration, the idea of power and functionality have become dominant elements of the style and of the whole project.
ENGINE
V4 di 90°: the racing soul
The new Desmosedici Stradale engine has been designed based on the experience gained in MotoGP. The typical approach used in competitions is found in the extraordinary power and torque values: the 90° V4 with a displacement of 1,103 cm³, the counter-rotating crankshaft and the 4 valves per cylinder with desmodromic distribution that reaches 214 hp (157.5 kW ) of maximum power at 13,000 rpm and 122 Nm (12.44 kgm) of maximum torque at 10,000 rpm.
TECHNOLOGY
Last generation electronics
The performance of the Desmosedici Stradale must always be easily manageable to achieve maximum racing results, optimising the energies and concentration of the rider. The new Panigale V4's control electronics use the six-axis inertial platform data (6D IMU) that make it possible to capture and record extensive amounts of information.
SAFETY
The new Panigale V4 sets new absolute performance benchmarks and raises vehicle safety and dynamics control standards with a state-of-the-art electronics package that maximises the potential offered by Bosch's six-axis inertial platform. Other original controls have also been introduced, like controlled slides during braking, ABS Cornering that acts only on the front brake with a setup that was designed specifically for track riding, and Quickshift Up & Down with a strategy that takes into account the lean angle.

I'm retired and have had this bike for almost three years, absolutely love it but don't ride it as much as I should. Turn-key go.
I would like to set up a mid-weight BDR bike for next year and I'm interested in the Suzuki DR650 as a potential old man mount. I've owned numerous dual sports, loved my KTM 450EXC, my DRZ400 was reliable fun and my XR650l was just a tall heavy pig that would take you anywhere as long as you didn't need to dab! I still have my XR250l buddy bike for the local trails and stuff.
I rode a DR650 and thought it was a good compromise, I could touch the ground! If you have a DR650 and are interested in a potential trade, give me a call.

Selling my trusty R65 which I have owned and loved since 2013.
Always well cared for and ridden in all conditions. Regular service and always garaged. I have all the service records from the previous owner and receipts for all upgrades I’ve made. This is a great riding bike and super fun. Well maintained by and for a balanced daily rider.
The R65 engine is narrower than other airheads and has a higher revving engine which was intended to serve as an urban commuter bike. The R65 was the engine used in the prototype GS in 1980! It likes to rev up to 5k to shift. I have taken this bike to the gravel roads of the Idaho panhandle, the redwoods of California and all over Oregon. It is a great bike and always starts. It transformed into a forest road scrambler over the years. It has standard suspension and has a low seat making it ideal for shorter riders looking for a stable ride.

2018 Husqvarna FC 450
MUSCULAR PERFORMANCE
Strong, yet usable engine performance catapults the FC 450 into contention at the top of the 450 class. The FC 450 has astonishing force from the SOHC engine, incredible handling from the lightweight, cutting-edge chassis, and embodies the core values of Husqvarna. The standard electric start and handlebar-mounted map switch make the FC 450 one of the most advanced Motocross bikes on the market.
Features may include:
Powerful engine
The SOHC engine is the perfect example of the advanced engineering techniques used by Husqvarna motorcycles. The 450cc offers a peak power of 63 hp at an overall weight of just 27.8kg. Mass-centralisation is key in the engine design, enabling chassis engineers to position the engine closer to the centre of gravity for greatly improved handling and manoeuvrability.
Gearbox
The lightweight 5-speed gearbox has a low-friction coating on the shifting fork guaranteeing smooth and precise shifting. The gear lever features a design that prevents dirt build-up and keeps the lever tip in its original position in even the toughest conditions while an advanced gear sensor allows for specific engine maps tailored for each gear.
Lightweight frame
With years of experience in designing the most advanced steel frames in offroad, the engineers in Research and Development designed a chromium molybdenum steel frame that redefines every structural aspect that benefits handling, ergonomics and packaging. With carefully calculated tortional and longitudinal flex, the frame works in harmony with the suspension to offer sharp handling and superior comfort. These characteristics, matched to a lightweight and compact engine design, offer exceptional handling precision while at the same time increasing bump-absorption and feeling.
Carbon fiber subframe
The use of carbon fibre strips away weight, improving weight distribution and bringing weight closer to the centre of gravity for precise handling. The composition of the material is 30% carbon fibre and the overall 3-piece construction is remarkably light but also very strong for an overall weight of 1.4 kg. Additionally, a specific rigidity has been calculated in the component for optimal handling and rider ergonomics.
Crankshaft
The inertia produced by the crankshaft has been carefully calculated to deliver optimal traction and ride-ability from the powerful 450cc plant. Perfectly positioned, the component harnesses the rotating mass at the ideal center of gravity resulting in a lightweight and agile handling feel. A plain big end bearing comprising of two force-fitted bearing shells ensure maximum reliability and durability, guaranteeing long service intervals of 100 hours.
CNC machined triple clamps
The black-anodized CNC machined triple clamps feature a rubber damping system that reduces vibration, increasing comfort. Additionally, the triple clamps have been meticulously designed to evenly distribute the clamping force on the fork leg, maximizing contact area for optimal sensitivity and minimum friction.
Magura hydraulic clutch
The high quality German-made Magura clutch system guarantees even wear, almost maintenance-free operation and perfect modulation in every condition. This means that play is constantly compensated so that the pressure point and function of the clutch remain identical in cold or hot conditions, as well as over time.

Comments for this 2018 BMW R NineT Urban G S:
2018 BMW R NineT Urban G/S
Eye-catching. Powerful. Air-cooled.
Enjoy the confident feel of a boxer with an upright and relaxed riding position, coupled with modern technology. Choose from countless customizing options to integrate your own unique ideas. The R nineT Urban G/S makes a clear statement: It pays tribute to the early days of BMW Motorrad's G/S success story. Just one look and it's clear that the R nineT Urban G/S captures the off-road spirit of that era. At the same time, its riding characteristics make it a true member of today's R nineT family.
The source of inspiration: unmistakable.
The design of the R nineT Urban G/S is eye-catching. Distinctive stylistic elements make it a powerful, robust bike that pays tribute to the original G/S design: the 19-inch front wheel, the telescopic fork with the familiar bellows, the headlamp mask with the windscreen and the raised front-wheel cover define the front of the bike. The profile is defined by a pronounced horizontal line. White body elements and the narrow, slightly longer red seat invoke the spirit of the legendary R 80 G/S from 1980. The black engine and frame highlight this effect. The new classic round instruments also show that the Urban G/S is part of the R nineT family. The R nineT Urban G/S also excels on everything from unpaved paths to gravel roads. The optional knobby off-road tires on spoked wheels, the Enduro foot pegs, the bolted-on heat shield and the steel footbrake lever emphasize the bike's purpose, both functionally and visually.
The R nineT Urban G/S also excels on everything from unpaved paths to gravel roads. The optional knubby tires and spoked wheels, the Enduro foot pegs, the bolted-on heat shield and the steel footbrake lever emphasize the effect, both functionally and visually.
Technology for pure riding fun.
The R nineT Urban G/S is faithful to tradition with its looks, but the bike shows equal respect for the present with its modern technology. It features the proven engine and electrical system of the BMW R nineT. The Urban G/S also meets the current EU-4 emission standard. The powerful air-cooled, two-cylinder boxer engine features a capacity of 1170 cc and 110 hp (81 kW) of output for a highly dynamic power delivery, even at low speeds. All for a light and modern riding experience. The standard ABS and optional ASC Automatic Stability Control help confidence in a range of riding conditions. One more direct visual reference to the enduro roots of the G/S is the raised exhaust system made of brushed stainless steel.
Upright and majestic.
The balanced ergonomic triangle of the Urban G/S keeps you agile and confident on the road: The slightly higher handlebar, the long seat surface and slightly deeper and wider rear mounted footrests make for a more relaxed and confident riding experience. The standard seat height of the series is 33.5. The optional lower seat height of 32.2 makes the R nineT Urban G/S a great fit for riders of almost all sizes.

2019 Yamaha YZ450F
CONNECTED AS ONE
Innovation meets acceleration. The 449cc liquid-cooled DOHC 4-stroke YZ450F sports industry-leading suspension, electric start and the smartphone power tuner app - so you can dial in your ride.
Features may include:
Engine
Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
The YZ450F's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system features a cylinder head that works with the frame geometry for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a long, straight intake tract, aggressive cam profiles, high-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these details give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
Yamaha Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha created the Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
Chassis/Suspension
Aluminum Frame
The YZ450F's compact frame further refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the sharpest machines in the class. Large upper frame bracing provides rigidity and durability, while rear frame spars and tuned engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and rider feeling.
Compact Body and Seat Design
The YZ450F features stylish bodywork from tip to tail, including a compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and control feeling, while the narrow seat gives the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Additional
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort, reduce handlebar vibration and allow riders to adjust the bar position, while the handlebar itself is strong but lightweight to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

He later filed for bankruptcy which he ended up including the bike in it. He lives 2 states away and didn’t want to come get it so we left it up to the bank to get it back.

We tried and tried to give it to the bank but they do not want it back. After having this bike in my garage for 3 years I need to get rid of it because I am moving soon and have no use for it. Obviously, I have no title or paper work on it which is why it’s priced so low.

Please do not message me with tips on how to get the title or anything of the sort. I do not have any time to put in to this bike. You get the bike and all my gear with it.

2007 Yamaha YZF-R1
All-new, light, powerful and packed with trickle-down MotoGP trickery, the YZF-R1 is the most advanced Open-class production motorcycle ever built.
Key Features May Include
All-new, light, powerful and packed with trickle-down MotoGP trickery, the YZF-R1 is the most advanced Open-class production motorcycle ever built.
All-new inline four-cylinder engine is the most powerful, tractable R1 powerplant ever, thanks partially to the world’s first electronic variable- length intake funnel system.
The YZF-R1 uses the YCC-T fly-by-wire throttle system for flawless response under all conditions.
Slipper-type back torque-limiting clutch greatly facilitates braking/downshifting from high speed.
All-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm take Open-class handling to the next performance level.
New, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers and 310mm discs generate the kind of braking power a bike like the new R1 requires.
Features & Benefits
Engine
Short-stroke 998cc DOHC, 16-valve, liquid-cooled inline four- cylinder engine produces more tractable power than ever.
Yamaha Chip Control Throttle controls a 32-bit ECU fuel injection system for super-responsive, smooth, instantaneous power delivery.
Yamaha Chip Control Intake electronically adjusts intake funnel length between either 65 or 140mm for an amazingly broad, smooth powerband.
Two-piece ergonomically designed fuel tank carries fuel in the rear section, for good centralization of mass, while the front half contains a Ram-Air-fed airbox for increased power.
Lay-down design cylinder head optimizes weight distribution, straightens intake tracts for improved cylinder filling, and allows frame to pass over instead of around the engine for great strength and a narrow chassis.
Closed-deck cylinder block increases strength and allows a narrow engine in spite of big, 77mm bores.
Narrow-angle four-valve combustion chambers produce a highly efficient 12.7:1 compression ratio; 31mm titanium intake valves and 25mm exhausts controlled by new, high-lift cams flow plenty of air.
Light and strong nutless connecting rods with fractured big ends produce a quick-revving engine with excellent high-rpm durability.
High silicon-content ceramic-composite cylinder sleeves ensure great heat dissipation for consistent power delivery and reduced friction.
Close-ratio six-speed gearbox with triangulated shaft layout for great strength, compactness, and quicker acceleration.
Ramp-type slipper clutch makes braking from speed into tight corners while downshifting smoother and therefore faster.
Redesigned titanium underseat exhaust system (with stainless steel midpipe and catalyst) provides excellent cornering clearance and a broad, seamless powerband.
13-percent greater radiator capacity and an aluminum liquid-cooled oil cooler maintain stable operating temperature.
Direct ignition coils, dual-electrode spark plugs and high-output magneto deliver extremely accurate, reliable firing.
AC generator behind cylinder block produces a narrow engine with excellent cornering clearance.
Chassis/Suspension
An all-new Deltabox frame tuned for optimal flex carries the lay-down four-cylinder stressed-member style, for great handling and efficient aerodynamic penetration.
A new truss-type swingarm is extremely strong and tuned for optimal traction and feedback.
Dual 310mm front disc brakes; new, six-piston radial-mount calipers and Brembo radial-pump front master cylinder with adjustable lever deliver amazing braking power and feel.
Fully adjustable KYB inverted telescopic front fork with 43mm tubes has been revalved to complement other chassis changes.

I’m the third owner, the bike has 18,500 miles, and has always had regular maintenance performed. I just picked it up from MotoCorsa, just spent $2,000 having the big 15k mile service done on it where everything on the bike was gone through. I had a new chain replaced as well as front and rear sprockets, and rear brake pads. I have receipts from all service and all additions on the bike going back to when the bike was new.

The S model comes equipped with a carbon fender belt covers and accessories, Brembo brakes, Arrow exhaust. The previous owner added a rear carbon fender/chain guard. S model also includes Ohlins adjustable shocks and Marchesi forged rims.
The bike has a great upright riding position, very comfortable on and off road.
The previous owner added a bunch of items to increase the off-road confidence. They include; upgraded foot pegs folding shift and brake levers, crash bars, cylinder head guard, Strada Avventurosa accessories, sump guard, off-road lighting with PIAA flood lights, off-road fender mount, fork guards. Also barkbuster hand guards, handle bar bag, 12v plug in and Ram mount for your iPhone

Included with this bike is another set of Marchesi Rims. (Although there are tires on these spare rims, they need replaced) The bike comes equipped with a luggage rack and rack extension and also an inner changeable back rest. For the $6000 price tag is included T Rex front and rear wheel lifts and tools to change out the wheels and chain adjustment wrench. I have all the original parts to return it back to stock. I also have all receipts for the aftermarket parts as well as service records documented. Test drives only allowed with letting me hold onto $6000cash while you take the bike out. Must also have helmet and motorcycle endorsement. Serious inquires only. Clean title in hand

2019 Yamaha Tracer 900 with SW-Motech crash bars and Givi top case, literally like new with just over 1K miles on it, charismatic three-cylinder engine with variable ride modes, a super fun-to-ride adventure/sport-touring bike! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2019 Yamaha Tracer 900
TURN UP YOUR EMOTIONS
Adaptable performance, good value and a long list of sport touring features makes this bike the perfect ride partner.
Features may include:
Engine
Advanced 3-Cylinder Powerplant
The Tracer 900 features an 847cc liquid-cooled, inline 3-cylinder, DOHC, 12-valve engine derived from the award winning MT-09. This engine combines high-tech components such as offset cylinders, fracture-split connecting rods and staggered intake funnels with a crossplane concept crankshaft to deliver an exciting, sporty engine character with plenty of torque for flexibility and relaxed highway comfort.
Crossplane Concept CP3® Engine
The Tracer 900 “crossplane crankshaft concept” engine provides linear torque development in response to the rider’s throttle input, for responsive engine thrust with a strong feeling of power in the low- to mid-rpm range. To boost refinement and provide a smoother ride, the CP3 engine uses a compact counterbalancer to cancel out vibration.
Assist and Slipper Clutch
Yamaha’s assist and slipper clutch gives the rider smoother, more confident downshifts when entering corners aggressively, as well as a lighter pull effort at the lever in day-to-day riding, all while easily handling the torque of the 847cc high-output motor.
Electronics
Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle
The ride-by-wire YCC-T system senses the slightest throttle input by the rider, instantaneously calculates the ideal throttle valve opening, and then actuates the throttle valves to actively control intake volume. This technology contributes to the rider’s feeling of torque and controllability from the 3-cylinder engine.
Selectable Engine Character
The Tracer 900 is equipped with Yamaha D-MODE (or “Drive Mode”) variable throttle control system. The rider can choose at will from three throttle valve control maps for different throttle response characteristics, each tuned specifically for the Tracer 900.
Chassis/Suspension
Plush, Controlled Suspension
For excellent damping characteristics, the front suspension is an inverted fork with 41mm inner tubes with 5.4 inches of travel. The front suspension features adjustment for spring preload and rebound damping.
Compact, Horizontal Monoshock
The rear suspension features a linked-type Monocross® shock. The shock is positioned below the seat and features an almost horizontal alignment. This unique positioning contributes to mass centralization and a slimmer body design. The rear suspension is also adjustable for spring preload and rebound damping.
Powerful, Controllable Brakes
Front brakes consist of two floating 298mm discs with 4-piston calipers. The calipers are radial mounted for improved feel just like Yamaha’s race-winning supersport machines. The standard anti-lock brake system (ABS) works to help prevent wheel lock during hard deceleration for additional braking security.
Additional
New Bodywork and Windscreen
The new windscreen is now taller, for improved wind protection and features a new one-handed adjustment system to three positions without the use of tools. Front nose to tail, the Tracer 900 features updated bodywork for a higher-quality, more cleanly integrated design.
Standard Centerstand
The Tracer 900 comes standard with a centerstand for added rider convenience when parking or performing cleaning and maintenance.

2018 Ducati Scrambler 1100
Bigger and more muscular than ever, but always manageable and agile. Just the way Scrambler intended. Because the 1100 is not just the most powerful Scrambler ever, thanks to the Monster’s engine; there’s also a lot of technology on board and a lot of work behind it. The seat is high and wide, comfortable for two; the pace is longer, the fork is increased and renewed, just like the tank, that is very capacious. But the cycling is the same one that made Scrambler a legend. And the borders of the Land of Joy can’t be seen anymore, not even on the horizon.

2015 MV Agusta F3 800
The exhilaration of a 1000cc Superbike with the handling of a 600cc Supersport. The torque of a V-twin and the rev limit of a four-cylinder, The MV Agusta F3 800 is the new performance frontier, the avantgarde three-cylinder motorcycle proudly made in Italy,
Features May Include:
Technical
Three-cylinder inline 798 cc engine
Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm (8.4 mm more than the F3 675)
Max. power 148 hp at 13,000 rpm (20 hp more than the F3 675)
Max. torque 88 Nm at 10,600 rpm
13,500 rpm limiter
Slipper clutch
Dry weight: 173 kg (same as the F3 675)
Power-to-weight ratio: 1.17 kg/hp (13.5% less than the F3 675, which has a ratio of 1.35 kg/hp)
New front brake set-up with Brembo monobloc calipers • Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsa tyres
Engine
Bore diameter remains unaltered at 79.0 mm, while the stroke has been increased from 45.9 mm to 54.3 mm, boosting displacement from 675 cc to 798 cc. Power output reaches a stunning 148 hp at 13,000 rpm, with the peak torque of 88 Nm arriving at 10,600 rpm. The rev limiter has been set to kick in at 13,500 rpm. A double overhead cam timing system with four titanium valves per cylinder gives awesome performance, especially at high revs. Improvements have also been made to the fuel injectors, which ensure higher flow rates than those on the F3 675.
Electronics
The 3-cylinder MV Agusta project features the most advanced electronics package ever seen in the mid-weight category, with the MVICS (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) platform combining fully electronic control of throttle and throttle body with traction control.
At the technological heart of the MVICS platform lies the Full Ride By Wire system: moment by moment, this defines the ideal throttle body aperture independently of the angular rotation of the twist grip. There is, in fact, no rigid mechanical linkage between throttle and butterfly: the optimum fuel-air mix is, instead, defined by injection-ignition mapping, giving best-ever performance at all times and under all load conditions.
Chassis
The same excellence that made its smaller sister bike so successful is, of course, an essential part of the MV Agusta F3 800. For a start, the wheelbase is a mere 1,380 mm, a record-breaking measurement that forms the foundation of this three-cylinder bike’s exceptional handling. The frame is the result of a clever combination of a main ALS tubular steel structure, a mid-section consisting of cast aluminium side plates and an extended swingarm (576.5 mm) designed to maximise traction.
A sophisticated 43 mm Marzocchi front fork - with 125 mm of travel, adjustable spring preload and compression and rebound adjustment – features dedicated settings that let the rider wring every last drop of excitement from the higher-performance 800 cc engine.

2019 Honda® Africa Twin Adventure Sports CRF1000L2
REDEFINING ADVENTURE.
Some people just can’t take “No” for an answer. Neither can some bikes. Enter the 2019 Honda Africa Twin and Africa Twin Adventure Sports. Designed for endless possibilities, they know no boundaries. Both share the same legendary engine and frame, but the Africa Twin Adventure Sports is optimized for range and comfort—with a bigger fuel tank, more suspension travel, a larger skid plate, wider footpegs, a larger windscreen, and more. This year, the Africa Twin is available in stunning Matte Black Metallic and Blue/White/Red, while the Africa Twin Adventure Sports is now available in Light Silver/Gray Metallic. So, whether you’re getting ready for a weekend or a year away, a Honda Africa Twin is ready and able.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
AFRICA TWIN ADVENTURE SPORTS
Designed for the most ambitious explorers, and loaded with features like a bigger fuel tank, more suspension travel, a larger skid plate, a flatter, more comfortable seat, wider footpegs and a taller windscreen. There’s even a standard-equipment rear rack. Available with either a six-speed manual or Honda’s revolutionary Automatic DCT transmission.
HANDLING
LONG-TRAVEL SUSPENSION
The Africa Twin doesn't just look like an adventure bike—it’s the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel suspension. The fork features huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel, while the single-shock Pro-Link® rear suspension is also fully adjustable, with 8.7 inches of travel and a convenient remote preload adjustment. Our Adventure Sports version offers 9.9 inches of travel up front and 9.4 inches of travel in the rear.
ENGINEERING
TRANSMISSION CHOICE
You pick: The Africa Twin and Africa Twin Adventure Sports are available with either our standard six-speed manual gearbox or Honda’s exclusive automatic six-speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). Both transmissions are excellent choices, and both feature stout, strong steel gears inside—the only difference is who does the shifting.

2018 KTM 1090 Adventure R Reduced Price! SKU: PJM982428,https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/mcd/d/portland-2018-ktm-1090-adventure/7583634766.html,7583634766.0,"02/02/2023, 15:06:12","$11,999","Description:

2018 KTM 1090 Adventure R set up for on- and off-road adventuring with parts from KTM Hard Parts, Barkbusters, EP, Hammerhead, Oberon, R&G, SW-Motech, Touratech, Yoshimura, and more! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

BRING IT ON
The KTM 1090 ADVENTURE R stares down anything in its path. Bespoke WP suspension, offroad wheels and a tough yet fuel-efficient engine are ready to rumble. Decades of rally raid victories roar within. This bike uses the same state-of-the-art technology as the KTM 1290 ADVENTURE R and even though its engine capacity is smaller, it’s still big on power: 125 hp (92 kW).
The world is yours - Devour it.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
The advanced V2 engine with a 1,050cc displacement supplies everything an adventure bike could ever need: powerful acceleration, real punch for fully loaded touring and 125 hp (92 kW) peak power for when the chips are down. Low fuel consumption and long service intervals of 15,000 km mean the bike is easy on the wallet too.
CHASSIS
In adding the ‘R’, we add a promise: excellent offroad abilities. So you get a 21 inch wire-spoked wheel at the front, 18 inch at the rear, floating on 220 mm of fully adjustable WP suspension. On top of that, KTM’s signature tubular trellis frame, steel crash bars and a high strength, die-cast, open-lattice swingarm are more eager than ever to earn their stripes. And that’s just the chassis side of things.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
At KTM, individualists are welcome. The bike’s ergonomics can be adjusted to suit the preferences and stature of any rider, wherever they may roam: Two handlebar clamping positions: horizontal +/- 10 mm, Two footpeg positions: 10 mm up and back (diagonally), Hand levers with 5 reach settings
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
The 1090 ADVENTURE R's shape leaves no doubt about its DNA. Pure, Offroad, Agile, Fast.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Sheer power under full control with the manners of a beast are made possible by the smoothly operating software and electronics. TC, ABS and ride modes support your riding gently and almost imperceptible. The only intervention you notice is the smile on your face.
ACCESSORIES & LUGGAGE
KTM know its customers like to modify and to travel, which is why the PowerParts range boasts a huge variety of accessories and luggage options across its Street range of sportmotorcycles – past and present. All PowerParts are developed alongside their chosen machine, meaning that KTM riders only get parts that perfectly complement their ride and provide that important ‘factory fit’ straight from the dealer.

2021 Ducati Streetfighter V4S Reduced Price! SKU: PMB002920,https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/mcd/d/portland-2021-ducati-streetfighter-v4s/7583572849.html,7583572849.0,"02/02/2023, 15:06:19","$22,499","Description:

Low-mileage 2021 Ducati Streetfighter V4S in classic Ducati Red with CRG billet adjustable leversand a New Rage Cycles tail tidy with LED turn signals, has mismatched radiator shrouds (right side is custom-painted black with red splotches; left side is silver) but is otherwise in excellent condition. * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2021 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S Ducati Red
The Fight Formula
The Panigale V4, stripped of its fairings and with high, wide handlebars. This, in short, is the underlying concept of the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that magnifies the thrill of the ride every time it takes to the road.
The result? An unrivalled naked bristling with cutting-edge technology and an awe-inspiring design that oozes pure performance.
The minimalist full-LED headlight captures the spirit of the Streetfighter V4 perfectly. On the one hand, it recalls the front of the Panigale V4 and, on the other, evokes the crazy grin of the Joker (the comic strip character from which the Ducati Style Center drew inspiration for this new Bologna-built naked). Already featured on the Panigale V4 and SuperSport, the V-shaped DRL is another clear Ducati hallmark.
Features may include:
DESIGN AND AERODYNAMICS
Ego Booster
The Panigale V4, stripped of its fairings and with high, wide handlebars. This, in short, is the underlying concept of the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that magnifies the thrill of the ride every time it takes to the road. The result? An unrivalled naked bristling with cutting-edge technology and an awe-inspiring design that oozes pure performance.
ENGINE
High Power
The new Streetfighter V4 is powered by a 1103 cc Desmosedici Stradale engine. In this configuration the 90° V4 delivers 208 hp (153 kW) at 12,750 rpm, an unrivalled power level within the naked segment, perfectly in keeping with the all-out character of the new Streetfighter V4. Maximum torque is 123 Nm at 11,500 rpm, practically unchanged with respect to the Panigale V4. Dedicated engine mapping lets riders safely make the most of Streetfighter V4 performance on the road.
The final ratio, shorter than that of the Panigale V4, delivers a wheel torque higher of +10%, which ensures an immediate response to the throttle command.
Power and torque can be raised to 220 hp (162 kW) and 130 Nm by fitting the full-racing Ducati Performance exhaust by Akrapovic that also reduces weight by – 6 kg.
CHASSIS AND ERGONOMICS
Ergonomics, more comfort, more control
Compared to the Panigale V4, the riding position - with an above-ground height of 845 mm - has been redefined as per the specifications of a naked model. In keeping with streetfighter culture, the semi-handlebars have been replaced by a high, wide bar that, together with a moderated footpeg position, ensures sports-style comfort during inner city rides and the control needed to tackle country roads or racetracks.
While maintaining many of the Panigale's stylistic features, the tail is supported by a steel subframe and has been redesigned to enhance passenger comfort and give the rider more lengthways space.
ELECTRONICS
MotoGP-derived electronics
The latest-generation electronics package on the Streetfighter V4 is based on a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (6D IMU) which instantly detects the bike's roll, yaw and pitch angles.
The electronics package has controls for every part of the ride: some oversee start, acceleration and braking, others govern traction and others again lend a helping hand on corners and out-of-the-corner stretches.

MV Agusta arguably produces the sexiest sportbikes of all, and this 2020 F3 800 with the factory accessory exhaust and just 1500 miles on the odometer is no exception! * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2020 MV Agusta F3 800
STREET-LEGAL SUPERSPORT
Features may include:
A SUPERFAST WORK OF ART
The distinctive three-exit exhaust, the aggressive-looking headlight unit and the single-sided swingarm, so beautiful it looks like a sculpture: just as with its 675, every detail of the F3 800 tells the story of another work of art crafted by MV.
FORMED BY SPEED
Every detail of the F3 800 is designed with a sole objective: making it faster. Form follows function, say the masters of design, and all with the unmistakable style of MV.
TRACTION AND AGILITY, WITH MORE POWER
Lightweight, agile, essential. The F3 800 defines a new paradigm in motorcycling. The road opens up as the speed increases. The bike almost becomes immaterial and creates a direct connection between rider and tarmac.
LONGER STROKE
Bore on the F3 800 is the same 79.0 mm, but the stroke increases from 45,9 mm (effective cubic capacity of 675cc) to 54,3 mm (effective cubic capacity of 798 cc), with the rev limiter intervening at 13.500 rpm. Higher-flow fuel injectors compared to the F3 675 ensure additional power, whilst it features the same counter-rotating crankshaft.
MORE POWER, MORE TORQUE
Thanks to the increased stroke of the crankshaft, the F3 800 delivers 148 hp at 13.000 rpm (+20hp with respect to F3 675), together with a maximum torque of 88 Nm at 10.600 rpm. More power, more torque (+17Nm), more adrenaline!
THE MOST ADVANCED ELECTRONICS IN ITS CATEGORY
The F3 800 features the latest evolution of the MVICS system with multi-map Full Ride by Wire, 8-level traction control and EAS 2.0 up & down electronic gearbox mated to a hydraulic slipper clutch. The electronic injection system has two injectors per cylinder with record 50 mm diameter throttle bodies.
THE BEST PARTNER FOR YOUR SAFETY
When all you have to think about is riding, fun and pleasure are at their top, especially since safety is ensured by the two-channel Bosch 9 PLUS ABS system with Race Mode. With Rear Wheel Lift-up Mitigation, the system controls the pressure applied on the front brake to avoid involuntary rear wheel lift-up.

2017 Ducati Panigale R with just over 2K miles, ready to tear up the twisties! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2017 Ducati Panigale R
Race-bred, start to finish
Born to race, the new Panigale R brings a thrill to the track. 205 hp* react instantly to a twist of the throttle thanks to ultralight engine components. Track-optimised geometry and racing suspension ensure responsive racetrack behaviour. Electronics are tuned to deliver maximum performance. A lithium-ion battery and a titanium Ducati Performance by Akrapovic exhaust will take you and 357 lbs of racing technology straight to the checkered flag.
Singular goal
The Panigale R has one goal - simply to dominate the track. Every feature is oriented in that direction; no compromises are made. For dedicated enthusiasts who seek the purest experience on track, the Panigale R delivers a shot of racing adrenaline directly to the heart.
Precious elements
The clutch cover, cylinder head covers, and oil pan are all cast in a golden-color magnesium alloy to ensure the engine's strength with the absolute lowest possible weight.
Lightweight racing engine
The Panigale R features an incredible 1198cc Superquadro engine which adopts the most advanced racing-derived features available. A precision-balanced lightweight crankshaft, two-ring Superbike pistons, titanium valves and connecting rods, and extreme camshaft profiles result in a 205 hp output with immediate, aggressive power delivery. Homologated for use as Ducati's platform in World Superbike, the Panigale R's Superquadro is the closest thing available to a dedicated race engine - but incredibly, offers the same generous warranty and long maintenance intervals as the rest of the bike.
Fully Ride-by-Wire
The opening and closing of throttle butterflies on the Superquadro is controlled by a fully electronic Ride-by-Wire system. The absence of a mechanical connection between the twistgrip and the throttle bodies allows the engine ECU to regulate power delivery by directly adjusting the throttle; Ride-by-Wire makes it possible to have different power and delivery based on the selected Riding Mode, to alter the level of engine back-torque (EBC), and to control any slipping of the rear wheel (DTC).

2019 BMW R nineT Pure with SW-Motech saddlebags, fashionable and fun! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2019 BMW R nineT Pure
PURE. REDUCED. AIR-COOLED.
The BMW R nineT Pure is perfect for everyone who loves the classic roadster design and is looking for a pure motorcycle experience. It is reminiscent of the 1970's and 80's era. But its roots go deeper. Even the very first motorcycle from BMW was simple and dynamic. Back then, in 1923, the BMW opposed-twin engine was already the heart of the entire concept. Today, the R nineT Pure offers you many options to customize your motorcycle. You can realize your dreams: for your bike and your lifestyle. You will feel its origin, whether you're customizing it, or enjoying the thrill of opening the throttle.
Reduced to the essentials
The design of the R nineT Pure is reminiscent of a typical roadster. The circular headlamp with a chrome ring, painted housing and the new circular tachometer influence the look of the front. The proportions are determined by the three-part bridge frame together with the new classic looking telefork. The supporting element: the opposed-twin engine, just waiting to roar. The steel tank and the typically narrow rear complete a silhouette that is both stylish and elegant: for an agile and self-confident appearance - and all carried by the striking 5 spoke cast wheels. However, the maximally stripped down design has nothing to do with fads or nostalgia. Rather the R nineT Pure allows you to customize the bike to the full: equip it, modify it, design it – your bike, your style.
Proven opposed-twin engine for completely individual ride.
The engine and the electrical system of the R nineT Pure already excited motorcycle fans in the R nineT. The air/oil cooled two cylinder opposed-twin engine with its 110 hp (81 kW) promises a lush, vital riding experience and keeps its promise – typical of a twin engine. The 2-in-1 exhaust system with a typical roadster-look emphasizes this style consciousness with a full, powerful sound. Thanks to standard ABS and optional ASC you can take this power safely to the streets.
Stylish and self-confident.
The R nineT Pure allows you to realize your dream of a custom motorcycle. Completely according to your ideas. Create your bike – in your style. Thanks to the comparatively low seat height, the motorcycle is suitable for many different body sizes. Additionally, you can lower your R nineT Pure further with the low-slung factory option. Deep, narrow and firmly padded, you'll ride in the best roadster manner – self-confident, unequivocal, and unmistakable.
Features may include:
Round headlight with BMW Logo.
The chrome-plated ring and body-colored housing underline the classic R nineT Pure look.
Front-wheel cover.
The lacquered cover adds a further classic touch at the front.
Classic round instrument speedometer.
Style and elegance with every glance into the cockpit.
""nineT"" logo on air inlet.
An unmistakable indicator of its family heritage.
Cast aluminium single-sided swing-arm.
A veritable highlight, both visually and functionally.
Variable rear.
The passenger frame can be disassembled. If you prefer to ride alone, a hump can also be installed as a special accessory.
Modern LED rear light.
An exciting contrast to the classic round headlight at the front.
2-in-1 exhaust system.
The stainless steel exhaust system emphasizes the classic roadster look.

2020 Honda CRF450R
HOLESHOT HUNGRY. PODIUM READY
Honda's incredible CRF450R just keeps getting better and better. And if you're looking to dominate the 450 class, this is the bike you want. A whole selection of updates this year make the bike look and handle even better.
Then there's the limited-production CRF450R Works Edition. The RWE gets all the improvements of the CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID DirtStar LT-X rims, a new, exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system with titanium header, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, a factory-spec gripper seat, and more.
Features may include:
HANDLING
NEXT-GENERATION ALUMINUM FRAME
The CRF450R's Next-Gen twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock's mounting point lower, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity for more holeshots. The frame geometry also helps improve traction, feeling and steering precision.
ENGINEERING
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We're talking about a special ECU program here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF450R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
CONVENIENCE
ELECTRIC STARTER
Kickstarting? Maybe if you're riding in the vintage class, but not here. By ditching the kickstarter entirely, our engineers can make the CRF450R lighter. Electric starters and lithium-ion batteries are so light now and so good that putting them on a bike like this is a win/win combination. And winning is what a CRF450R is all about.
PERFORMANCEf
EXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITION
Homologated for racing and available in limited numbers, the CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the improvements of this year's CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID DirtStar LT-X rims, an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium header, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and an HRC decal package.

Comments for this 2016 Suzuki RM-Z450:
2016 Suzuki RM-Z450
The RM-Z450 continues to evolve for 2016, delivering a higher level of performance while maintaining the great balance of the current model. The 449cc 4-stroke liquid-cooled DOHC 4-valve fuel-injected engine along with new performance upgrades straight from the factory is the reason why champions choose Suzuki!
Features may include:
Refined for further rider control, the Suzuki Holeshot Assist Control (S-HAC) is a selectable launch system derived from the factory race bike to help riders' takeoff from the starting gate for an early lead. There are three modes riders can choose for the best option per their skill level and starting conditions.
A Mode: For hard surfaces or less than ideal conditions at the starting gate, hold down the S-HAC switch for more than 0.7 seconds
B Mode: When there is better traction and a more aggressive launch is needed, hold down the S-HAC switch for more than 1.8 seconds.
The SFF-Air suspension evolved from the SFF system but without a conventional coil spring resulting in reduced weight, increased inner tube diameter and damper rod/piston size. SFF-Air utilizes three tunable chambers so riders can easily adjust the spring rate with an air pump instead of changing out steel springs.
New light weight front brake caliper reduces mass while still providing outstanding stopping force.
449cc 4-stroke liquid-cooled DOHC 4-valve fuel-injected engine delivers phenomenal idle-to-redline performance
The compact aluminum cylinder is finished with Suzuki Composite Electrochemical Material (SCEM) coating for durability, light weight and efficient heat transfer.
The piston pin has Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) surface treatment, for less friction and increased durability.
449cc 4-stroke liquid-cooled DOHC 4-valve fuel-injected engine developed to deliver phenomenal idle-to-redline performance
Designed for motocross-use, the lightweight, battery-less, electronic fuel injection system with progressive throttle linkage delivers efficient power. A 12-hole fuel injector sprays a fine fuel/air mist for efficient combustion.
For quick fuel adjustments to suit riding conditions, two couplers are provided. One is for rich and another for lean fuel setting compared to stock setting. Riders can change fuel settings in seconds by simply connecting either coupler to the wire harness.
Engine starting is easy due to a long kick starter lever, refined internal gears, and decompression system that works precisely and efficiently.
Cooling performance is efficient with hose routing that is balanced between the left and right radiators, and a high capacity coolant pump.
Refined 5-speed transmission enables precise gear shift operation. The transmission feel has been improved with a revised shift cam for accurate gear selection. Specialized machining processes increase the precision of the matching gears.

Bought brand new for daughter during July 2022, but she likes horses more so this bike barely was ridden. It is basically brand new without even a scratch, and includes spares which I purchased but never needed. It was mostly ridden a few times in the yard.

This bike is built with amazing quality for a kid’s bike, like a miniature KTM. It is narrow which allows kids to touch the ground easily and not catch footpegs in ruts. The hydraulic brakes have kid size master cylinders and levers, it has black aluminum rims with Michelin Starcross tires (14” front and 12” rear), real footpegs and the list goes on and on. The bike with battery ready to ride only weighs 77 lbs! The light weight is the main reason I chose this bike for my daughter over a CRF-50, TTR-110 or similar gas bike. The light weight with top of the line tires and geometry make it handle and corner very well. It’s a good looking little bike.

Seat Height: 25.2”
Weight: 77 Lbs.
The seat height is taller than a standard 50, and a little lower than a 110, it weights about half as much and will smoke a 50 in a drag race and beat all the trail bikes at corner speed. Comparing it to a PW-80 it climbs hills much better.

The power levels and top speed are programmable via the app, and it also has a half-speed switch located behind the engine cover to slow your kid down if need be.

Spare Parts included which I purchased and never needed:
1. Extra quik change battery $485
2. Extra charger $129
3. Spare front brake lever $12
4. Spare rear brake lever $12
5. Spare electronic throttle assembly $27
6. Spare front tube $19
7. Spare rear tube $15
8. Spare grips L+R $7

Spare battery, charger, and parts value $706
MSRP for 2022 Motocross Two $3,250
Total MSRP bike and parts $3,956

Other than an occasional chain lube, there really isn’t much maintenance required.

2022 KTM 890 Duke
THE SCALPEL
The KTM 890 DUKE redefines the word 'sharp' by adding an extra edge. Powered by an 889 cc parallel-twin nestled into one of the lightest and most compact chassis around, the KTM 890 DUKE boasts the agility you'd expect from a 600 cc, but with the meaty punch of a bigger twin. It doesn't rewrite the mid-sized naked bike rule book. It obliterates it.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The LC8c engine shares a great deal of its ferocity with the ultra-sharp KTM 890 DUKE R. Boasting a hard-hitting 115 Hp and 92 Nm, this compact, liquid-cooled 8 valve powerplant, is the most compact twin in class punching way above its weight in terms of output.
CHASSIS
Frame
The incredible handling characteristics of the KTM 890 DUKE are founded on the dynamic, loadbearing design of the tubular chassis. Engineers had one goal in mind, and that was to keep the chassis as rigid and compact as possible for sharper turn-in and greater lean angles, allowing it to slice through the turns with extreme responsiveness.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
A tapered aluminum, 760 mm wide handlebar puts you in full control. It's adjustable, with 4 positions on the triple clamp and can be rotated in three further positions for that perfect riding position.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
TFT dashboard
Like all pilots, DUKE riders need easy access to information. In that regard, the KTM 890 DUKE features an intuitive multicolor, light variable TFT dashboard. Best of all, as the revs rise, the display bars change color to indicate when to shift, either spurring you on or warning you that the engine is too still cold for flat-out backroad attacks.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Rider Aids
The KTM 890 DUKE has adopted a vast swathe of rider aids found on the blistering KTM 890 DUKE R, and further refined them to be more user and road-friendly, without hindering any performance.

Vehicle Comments:
Good shape for a used dirtbike, excellent powerband in this year! Start up easy and sounds good. The Honda CRF 250R is a dirt bike that was first released in 2017. It is equipped with a 250cc single-cylinder four-stroke engine, which is capable of producing strong power and acceleration. The bike also has advanced suspension components, including a Showa inverted fork and a Pro-Link rear shock, which help to provide a smooth and controlled ride. In terms of design, the CRF 250R features a compact and lightweight frame, as well as a variety of other performance-enhancing features such as a quick-shifting transmission and powerful brakes.

2017 Honda® CRF250R
It’s Winning Time.
Racing can be challenging, rewarding, heartbreaking, and intensely satisfying—all in the same weekend! It has a way of separating the best from the rest in a way everyone can see. It’ll make you dig deep and bring your best game to the gate—because you can be sure the other guy is doing just that. And racing is no different for a company, either. Our engineers have to work hard to bring you the best bikes in the class, and it’s all on the line when that start gate drops. And that’s exactly why you should be on a Honda CRF®250R.
The CRF®250R is a finely-honed racing machine, but since it’s a Honda it’s also one of the most rider-friendly bikes you can find. Just look at how many privateers roll up to the track with a Honda in the back of their truck. Our 2017 model features a powerful, compact Unicam® engine with a high-lift cam and titanium intake and exhaust valves. The unique twin-muffler exhaust keeps the bike’s weight and center of mass symmetrical, so the handling is unmatched. A Showa® air fork makes the CRF®250R easy to fine-tune at the track, and the fully adjustable Showa rear suspension likewise lets you dial the bike in fast.
Wanna win? This is the bike you want to ride. The 2017 Honda CRF®250R—the machine that can make it happen for you.Features may include:
Powerful Unicam® Engine
The CRF®250R’s unique Unicam engine is both compact and powerful. Two-fifties tread a fine line between power and peakiness—the CRF®250R gets it perfect.
Next Generation Showa® SFF Fork
Lighter and easier to tune than a conventional-spring fork, the CRF®250R’s Showa® SFF-TAC air fork improves suspension reaction and simplifies adjustments for track conditions. A Schrader valve for the balance chamber makes it easy to tune.
Choose Your Power
This handlebar-mounted mode-select button lets you dial in engine power delivery character with a push of your thumb. Choose between Standard, Smooth and Aggressive, depending on track conditions.
Twice As Good
The CRF®250R pioneered our twin-muffler exhaust system. The two-pipe design means that each muffler is shorter, mounts lower and is tucked in much closer to the bike’s center of mass.

Fresh front tire - rx model - electric start

2018 Honda® CRF450RX
YOUR ULTIMATE OFF-ROAD ADVANTAGE.
When the Honda CRF450RX hit the scene last year, it blew everyone away. This was more than just a premier-class motocrosser with an electric starter. It’s a serious off-road weapon fully optimized for trophy-class competition in enduros, hare scrambles, and GNCC racing. This year we’ve upgraded the battery to a lithium-ion unit for lighter weight and better performance, and removed the kickstarter to also save weight. If you’re serious about winning and want the biggest advantage you can find, the 2018 Honda CRF450RX delivers.
Features may include:
ENGINEERING
Electric Start
The 2018 CRF450RX comes with a lightweight electric-starting system as standard equipment. The lithium-ion battery is also super light. It’s a win/win combination.
Large Fuel Tank
Stopping for fuel in a race costs time. With the CRF450RX’s 2.2-gallon fuel tank, depending on the course and how much roost you’re making everyone else eat, it’s possible to make it through a three-hour enduro with just one fuel stop.
Engine Mode Select Button
This simple, handlebar-mounted button lets you dial in engine power delivery character with a push of your thumb. Choose between Standard, Smooth, and Aggressive, depending on course conditions.
HANDLING
18-Inch Rear Wheel
An 18-inch rear wheel is another indication of our fine-tuning the CRF450RX for off-road racing. Whether it’s red Georgia clay, Florida loam, or Baja sand and rocks, you’re going to find this bike offers the performance you need.
Off-Road Suspension with Spring Fork
Designed specifically for the demands of off-road riding, the CRF450RX’s Showa® Spring Fork and suspension components are fully adjustable and chosen to give you the ultimate tunability and performance in the field for changing conditions.
New Dual-Muffler Exhaust System
The CRF450RX’s dual exhaust system is compact and positioned closer and lower in the frame’s center to take weight off the rear end and bring more mass to the bike’s center for superior handling.
PERFORMANCE
Dunlop Geomax Off-Road Tires
The Geomax AT81 tires are specially designed for off-road riding, and help the CRF450RX hook up and put its holeshot traction to the ground.
Aluminum Frame
Our twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock’s mounting point low, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity. The frame geometry also helps give you more traction, and that means more holeshots!
Cylinder Head Layout
The CRF450R uses our latest finger-follower rocker design. The Unicam cylinder head remains the most efficient in the MX world, giving you the design and performance of a double-overhead-cam layout but the compactness of a single-overhead-cam design.

 2020 BMW R 1250 RS Imperial Blue Metallic SPORTY TOURING IN THE FAST LANE. Each tour is determined by two factors: time and distance. With the new BMW R 1250 RS you can get more out of every tour. The rich 105 lb-ft torque and 136 hp of the new boxer engine accelerate you quickly to your cruising speed. The innovative BMW ShiftCam technology offers you more torque over the entire speed range, so you can rocket to an impressive sprint in every riding situation. The redesigned front gives the full-LED headlight a fresh, sporty look and performs or rides aerodynamically into the wind. This way, you can ride quickly and comfortably at any time. One thing is certain - no matter how much road you ride, with the R 1250 RS your riding pleasure grows with every mile you ride. Full power ahead. BMW ShiftCam is the name of the innovative technology that lets you accelerate faster from any speed. This is achieved by means of a variable camshaft control system. The increase to 136 hp gives you more power and, with the capacity expansion to 1254 cc, the possibility to make another sprint in the fast lane. The increase in torque (max 105 lb-ft) is noticeable in every rpm range, delivering the typical boxer punch an pure riding pleasure. Dynamic ESA of the latest generation. Dynamic ESA ensures more stable and even safer ride characteristics. The system automatically regulates the damping and spring preload of the struts depending on riding conditions and load. And it offers the highest level of comfort and traction on all surfaces, even in an inclined position. The inverted gold-colored fork is also part of the Dynamic ESA package. Connectivity. Connect your smartphone to your bike via Bluetooth. The 6.5-inch TFT displays important information from the motorcycle and offers you, in conjunction with your smartphone app, additional features such as navigation, music and phone.

I’m the second owner and have had the bike for about four years now. I’ve kept the bike stock condition for the most part other then a couple of mods. This is a second bike for me and does not get ridden as much as I’d like so I’ve decided to part ways with her. She has never been dropped has 19k for miles, and is always garage kept. I’ve got a clean title in hand, only looking to sell, no trades.
Mods:
- Carbon Fibre Akropovic slip on
- EDR Performance ECU Street tune
- Vortex shorty levers
- Double bubble smoked windscreen

Serviced every 3k with Motul full synthetic oil. Currently running Engine Ice in radiator.

EDR Has replaced spark plugs, new battery a few months ago, and a new stator has also been replaced.

It’s a fantastic bike and a hard year to find in this condition.",gas,19000.0,manual,,excellent,clean,750.0,blue,,sport bike,,,,,

2007 Harley-Davidson® Road Glide®
A uniquely designed ""shark nose"" fairing and sleek styling make the FLTR Road Glide® stand out among Harley-Davidson® touring motorcycles. The frame-mounted fairing reduces weight on the fork and handlebar giving the Road Glide® an enjoyable highway ride with protection from the elements. That ride gets even better for 2007, with the addition of the Twin Cam 96™ engine and 6-speed Cruise Drive transmission for improved power and relaxed cruising. The Road Glide® instrumentation features the 40-watt Advanced Audio System by Harman/Kardon. Hard-shell saddlebags, cruise control and Electronic Sequential Port Fuel Injection (ESPFI) are standard. Black slashing graphics add an original color contrast. The Road Glide® is available in nine solid color combinations for 2007.",gas,28457.0,other,1HD1FS4117Y672872,,clean,,,,,,,,,

2015 Harley-Davidson® CVO™ Street Glide®
The CVO™ Street Glide® motorcycle. This is the hot rod bagger decked out fender to fender with Premium BOOM!™ Audio Sound, infotainment, custom details and mind-blowing paint.
Features May Include:
Project RUSHMORE - Control
Here are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there’s wet pavement. We’ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we’ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.
Project RUSHMORE - Infotainment
More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Or as more than one rider asked: “Why can’t the infotainment system on my motorcycle blow away the ones the car companies put in their cars?” We couldn’t agree more. Check out the infotainment system Project RUSHMORE brought to the sport of motorcycling. You won’t believe your eyes. Or ears.
Project RUSHMORE - Feel
We dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Airflow, heat management, seat textures, legroom and hand controls all went under the hard microscope of the road and got tested and re-tested by real riders and worked and re-worked by us until we were satisfied we had built the most comfortable machines on the road. We all want to go farther, and when you're more comfortable in the saddle, you can.
Exclusive CVO™ Motorcycle Enhancements
All the quality. All the legacy of the Harley-Davidson name. Plus custom touches and performance that distinguish you from every other bike on the road. Sure there's a little vanity. Premium custom. Big, tricked-out wheels. Deep attention to details. The perfect storm of engineering and style you'll only find on a custom machine. And you'll spoil yourself with the accessories—from comfort to electronics to chrome. But the real signature of a Harley-Davidson® Custom Vehicle Operations™ motorcycle is the explosive power and sleek detailing of the huge Twin Cam 110™ engine with Screamin' Eagle® engine badges. It's custom-built, not just for anyone, but for true connoisseurs of the road.",gas,,other,1HD1PXN19FB962271,,clean,,white,,,,,,,

Super Nice Nice Nice Ducati Scrambler - For sale in Hillsboro Oregon - Under 1k Miles - A must see

If you're looking for a bike that's as beautiful as it is powerful, as versatile as it is fun, then the 2018 Ducati Scrambler 1100 is the one for you. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

2018 Ducati Scrambler Caf Racer
The Ducati Scrambler Caf Racer, Scrambler's interpretation of the legendary bikes that created a revolution in the motorcycle world, is an expression of free spirit and an emblem of style. Its ""Black Coffee"" colour brings back the 60s to today's Land of Joy.
The typical Scrambler teardrop tank with interchangeable panels is combined with a new seat, specially designed and equipped with a seat cover for the passenger. The handlebars with mirrors attached to the ends are typical of 60s racing; the same goes for the Termignoni exhaust with double silencer, the headlight fairing, the side number holders and the new Pirelli Diablo™ Rosso II with 17'' aluminium wheels. The styling is a clear reference to the style of the Rockers that in those days sped through the streets of the English capital.
The Ducati Scrambler Caf Racer reinterprets what was one of the most influential movements in the history of motorcycling, recreating a legend with a contemporary character reflecting the essence of the Scrambler.
Features may include:
Pirelli Diablo Rosso II
Black anoduized aluminum Termignoni muffler covers
Dedicated colour scheme
Clip-on handlebars
Radial front brake pump
Aluminum gold wheels 17"" front/17"" rear
Euro 4 black engine with brushed fins
Short fairing
""Cafe Racer"" seat
Handlebar rearview mirrors
Dedicated side number plate

Comfort as modern as this morning’s news and the power from our High Output Twin Cam 103™ engine, but the look still blazes straight from this machine’s authentic dresser past.

The Heritage Softail® Classic drips with the nostalgia of days gone by, but that’s only half of the equation for the rider of today. The hidden suspension gives you the authentic look without the bone-shaking ride of an old Hardtail. You get the comfort of cruise control for those long stretches of pavement. A redesigned seat and redesigned leather saddlebags. And best of all, a new High-Output Twin Cam 103™ engine. We’re not about to re-invent this look. But we never stop re-inventing the ride.
Features may include:
Authentic Styling
Get an eyeful of a Softail motorcycle and you see more than some weepy-eyed exercise in nostalgia. You’re looking at the kind of style that has the power to defy time. Honest. Uncluttered. Unaffected by the fad of the moment. There’s a good reason for this. We’ve used our long decades on the road, riding, wrenching, talking to other custom bike fanatics, to discover what works. Then we stick with it, and use it to push the boundaries of motorcycle design ever further. Take a look at the horseshoe oil tank adorning our Softail models. It’s the same one you’d see on a restored dresser from the ‘50s, or a radical Panhead chopper from the ‘70s. And you’ll find it right now on future Harley-Davidson models that still on the drawing board. Other companies may be content to imitate bits and pieces from our long history. On a Softail motorcycle every part down to the axle nut cover comes from an authentic tradition. With a genuine reason for looking the way it looks.
Iconic Engine
The air-cooled 45° V-Twin engine at the heart of every Softail model is a prime example of what makes a Harley-Davidson motorcycle more satisfying than anything else. Its clean, uncluttered shape fits perfectly in the downtubes of the frame. Twist the throttle and the surge of torque hits you exactly where it counts. The knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it’s been put to particular good use to power the Softail family. We counterbalance the engine, which means we can bolt it directly to the frame. It keeps the styling tight at the center of the bike. It lets the rider feel the pulse of the V-Twin. Yet there aren’t any vibrations rattling the fillings out of your teeth. What’s good gets even better for 2016. The Softail family gets a power upgrade to the new High Output Twin Cam 103™ engine. More power is always a Harley-Davidson tradition.
Technology
The beauty of the technology on a Softail motorcycle is that it never looks technological. That didn’t happen by accident and it doesn’t come easy, particularly when you consider that the inspiration for the family is the clean, wide-open lines of a vintage hardtail. Clutter it up with too many high tech doo-dads and you have a different machine entirely. Take a look at the anti-lock brakes now standard on many Softail models and available across the line. ABS gives you the control you want on a modern motorcycle. But our teams of industrial designers and engineers weren’t finished until the whole system had a streamlined design. The same goes for the clean look to the handlebars, thanks to a new electronic throttle system on every Softail model. With each passing year, adding a little technology to the ride looks better and better.",gas,13191.0,other,1HD1BWV32GB044504,,clean,,blue,,,,,,,

2016 Indian Motorcycles Chief Classic
PURE UNCOMPROMISING STYLE
Abundant power. Restless innovation. And unmistakable style. The stripped down essence of an iconic marque.
Stripped down until all that's left is an irresistible urge to ride. Take it all in, and you'll see a front end that drips with chrome and a light-up headress on the deeply valanced front fender leading the way. There's always somebody who wants to get a better look at the Classic's beautiful curves.

2020 Husqvarna FC 450
MASTERSTROKE
The pinnacle of Husqvarna motocross, the FC 450 uses advanced engineering techniques to not only draw 63 hp from the 450cc motor, but also position the engine shaft arrangements at the ideal centre of gravity to vastly benefit handling and manoeuvrability. The addition of launch control means perfect acceleration off the line, while class-leading ergonomics and traction control keep the rider in full control.
Features may include:
POWERFUL ENGINE
The SOHC cylinder head is incredibly compact and lightweight using a short profile with the camshaft located as close to the center of gravity as possible, significantly improving handling and agility. The lightweight valves are actauted via a rocker arm and feature timing specifically designed to deliver precise levels of torque and throttle response.
INTERCHANGABLE AIRBOX COVER
Designed with precisely positioned inlet ducts aimed at reducing drag and air flow deformation, the airbox ensures unrestricted airflow with maximum filter protection. The TWIN AIR filter is easily accessed without tools, by simply removing the left side panel for easy maintenance. Offering further performance customisation, the MY20 FC 450 is delivered with an additional airbox cover that can be changed without the use of any tools for a sharper throttle response according to rider preference or track conditions.
LIGHTWEIGHT FRAME
The chromium molybdenum steel frame harnesses advanced geometries and flex characteristics aimed at providing unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium blue powder coating with standard frame protectors for superior protection and durability.
CARBON FIBER SUBFRAME
The use of carbon fiber strips away weight, improving weight distribution and bringing weight closer to the center of gravity for precise handling. The composition of the material is 30% carbon fiber and the overall 3-piece construction is remarkably light but also very strong for an overall weight of 3.1 pounds. Additionally, a specific rigidity has been calculated in the component for optimal handling and rider ergonomics.

2014 Yamaha FZ6R
TIME TO RIDE!
The FZR6R offers features that make it easy for riders to get started: a low seat height, grips that reach back to you, and a torquey, 600cc engine you won't out grow anytime soon. Add a beautiful diamond-steel frame that sleek fairing, an R6-style exhaust and a price that makes it way more affordable than it looks, and it all adds up to the ultimate first sportbike.

Key Features May Include:

A rider in the market for an entry level or commuter 600cc bike doesn't have to compromise performance or style to get value. The FZ6R is a great combination of performance, handling, and exciting sport bike style, but also with a low seat height that's both adjustable to fit a wider variety of riders and also narrower where it counts to make it even easier to put both feet on the ground.

The engine delivers smooth power just the way today's rider needs it, brisk acceleration with plenty of torque that makes it a pleasure to get around town, with lots in reserve for when you want more. This is certainly not a no frills motor. Its derived from the FZ6 motor, fuel injected and tuned for outstanding low to mid engine performance.

Even if your primary goal is commuting to school or work, you want to be able to get out and have fun riding some twisty back roads. The FZ6R is ready to put a grin on your face! The diamond-shaped frame, made of high-tensile steel pipes using the engine as a structural member of the chassis, becomes the foundation for handling performance. It's designed to provide the right rigidity balance to contribute to smooth cornering performance.

When it comes to putting power to the pavement, the FZ6R uses nothing less than quality radial tires, 120/70R-inch front and 160/60R 17-inch rear. And this bikes excellent stopping performance is due to the dual 298mm front discs and 245mm rear disc, both with comfortable-to-use controls.

The fuel-injected engine in the FZ6R has been designed to meet the demands of today's motorcyclist. This engine optimizes the entire flow from the intake of the fuel-air mixture to combustion and exhaust. Even though it shares both bore and stroke dimensions with the FZ6, the cylinder head, crankcase, intake and exhaust system, as well as the clutch and shifter, were completely redesigned for the FZ6R, creating a power unit with an entirely different character.

The 600cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke in-line 4-cylinder engine is ready to respond with smooth, linear performance when the rider twists the throttle. Maximum output is achieved at a spirited 10,000 rpm and maximum torque is obtained at 8,500 rpm. Bottom line: Its outstanding torquey low to mid rpm engine performance is just right for someone who enjoys commuting to work or school or riding the canyons on the weekends.

With its exciting sport bike looks, onlookers will know this isn't just another middleweight bike. There's no mistaking Yamaha's high-performance heritage in the FZ6R.

The seat has separate front and rear sections, and the rider's seat features an innovative height adjustment mechanism. The seat can be set 20mm just over 3/4 of an inch higher for taller riders, a change that can make a big difference on an all-day ride.

The handlebar position can be adjusted 20mm forward by rotating the handlebar clamps to fine-tune rider comfort.

Nice Nice Nice - Low Hours -

2022 Husqvarna® FC 350
With the agility of a 250 and a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, the FC 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, making for a more user-friendly riding experience in all conditions. It is this versatility, paired with intelligent traction and launch control, which makes the FC 350 one of the most multitalented motocrossers on the market.
For 2022 we upgraded the hydraulic clutch to an all new high-performance Brembo system for perfect modulation at all times. On top, striking new dark blue and white graphics stylishly adorn the Swedish inspired design.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Weighing in at only 27.2 kg (59.9 lb) and churning out serious power, the engine in the FC 350 is designed with performance as a priority. It is also one of the lightest engines in its class.
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at the highest level for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points are specifically positioned to allow seamless movement around the motorcycle.
MAP SWITCH
Optimized for easy operation, the map switch selects between two engine maps, operates launch control and activates a traction control feature. Traction control works by analyzing throttle input from the rider and the rate at which the RPM increases. If the RPM increases too quickly, the EMS will register a loss of grip and reduce the amount of power to the rear wheel ensuring maximum traction.
COOLING SYSTEM
Made using high-strength aluminium, the cooling system on the FC 350 features computational fluid dynamics to channel air through the radiators more efficiently. The cooling system is also integrated into the frame allowing improved cooling by channelling coolant through the frame while eliminating the need for additional hoses.

Super nice condition and well-maintained DRZ400s with around 2K in upgrades - original owner and clear title

This was always my second bike and mostly used for light commuting carried on the back of my motorhome and utilized mostly for Fire roads and a couple of motorcycle camp trips. It has always been stored indoors. It is very lightly modified with practical accessories.

Modifications and accessories:
The engine runs perfectly, has plenty of power, and is efficient so I chose to keep it pretty stock for reliability. I've run it from sea level to 5000 feet elevation with no issues.
Engine - 3x3 airbox mod / K&N air filter / carb re-jet

Aluminum skid plate
Acerbis metal wrap-around hand guards
Cyclops LED headlight
Double Take Enduro mirrors
Aluminum engine case guards
Supersprox Stealth rear sprocket 47T (44-tooth OEM sprocket included)
Supersprox 14 and 16 front sprocket (currently I am running 16/47 which is about the same ratio as the 15/44 that came on it stock. By swapping out the front sprocket to 14 it makes it a much better offroad bike and is the same gearing as the DRZ400E. What is cool is there is enough adjustment in the chain to swap from 14,15,16 front sprockets on the fly.)
IMS Pro Series foot pegs
Tusk Tail Rack
Tusk pannier racks
Tusk Pilot pannier bags with quick-release plate (has waterproof outer shell)
Tusk Olympus tank bag (has waterproof outer shell)
Custom waterproof tube storage case (pictured) This will hold an aluminum fuel or water bottle or can be used for anything that would fit in a tube.
Seat Concepts Comfort XL seat. I will also include the original Suzuki OEM seat and Suzuki comfort Gel seat neither of which is as good as the seat Concepts.
Battery maintainer

Along with the original owner's manual and OEM tool kit, I am including a Clymer maintenance and repair manual.

The first few seconds of the race are critical for getting ahead of the pack. With a more powerful engine and updated technology, the time from the starting gate to the first turn just got a lot quicker.
MASTER THE PASS

2018 Aprilia Tuono V4 1100 Factory ABS * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2018 Aprilia® Tuono V4 1100 Factory ABS
POWER IN ITS DNA
THE LATEST AND MOST SPECTACULAR EVOLUTION OF A SPORT NAKED DYNASTY
For the fastest and sportiest naked ever, a direct descendant of the RSV4, four-time world SBK champion, a new evolutionary step has arrived which allows exceptional levels of performance to be achieved. The new, sophisticated electronic management includes an advanced dynamic controls package with APRC, Cornering ABS, Pit Limiter and Cruise Control.
The inimitable 175 hp V4 earns Euro 4 approval, without sacrificing any of its superb performance. Improved suspension and brakes.
Features may include:
Euro 4 engine, the same exciting performance
The Tuono V4 1100 is the only naked powered by a 65° V4 engine with unique characteristics. The narrow V architecture has made it possible to make an engine that is extremely compact lengthways which helps to centralise weights and to have a compact chassis. The changes made in this evolution of the Italian V4 not only resulted in earning Euro 4 approval, but also in increasing overall reliability and performance, without sacrificing any of the great character and marvellous sound that bikers love so much. The powerplant earns a new exhaust system with a silencer that has a double oxygen sensor and a built in valve. The engine ECU is new, with superior calculating capacity able to manage the rise in maximum revs, now 500 rpm higher. In order to guarantee maximum reliability, decreasing friction at the same time, the piston pins have DLC surface treatment, whereas the connecting rod heads boast a surface honing treatment.
Suspension and brakes directly from the new RSV4
If, on one hand, the new Tuono V4 range fully confirms all the proverbial qualities of handling and stability stemming from a frame that is closely derived from that of the Aprilia RSV4, seven-time World Superbike champion, on the other, it introduces important news in the brakes and suspension department. The front Brembo braking system comes directly from the one on the new RSV4 and relies on a pair of new steel discs that have been increased to 330 mm, gripped by the new monobloc M50 callipers and activated by a radial master cylinder on the handlebar. Aprilia Tuono V4 1100 Factory also has a prestigious Öhlins NIX, with fully adjustable hydraulics and spring preload. This unit saves about 400 grams compared with the previous one and is combined with the same brand rear shock absorber and steering damper (also adjustable).
Completely revamped electronics
The greatest innovations have to do with the Aprilia Tuono V4's on board electronics, that has always been considered as the “best in class”, where the APRC system stands out. Aprilia Performance Ride Control is the patented control suite derived directly from the winning technology in world Superbike, the most complete and refined of those available on the market. The fourth generation of APRC, standard on the Tuono V4 1100,fits in perfectly with the fine electronic management of the new full Ride-by-Wire throttle, that has allowed all superfluous throttle body electronic management components to be eliminated, thereby saving 590 grams. The repositioning of the inertial platform that allows APRC operation has improved accurate detection of the dynamic conditions of the bike, resulting in more efficient electronic control strategies.
Versions and colours
The new Aprilia Tuono V4 1100 range includes two models distinguished by different technical equipment and different colour schemes: Tuono V4 1100 RR is available in two attractive colour schemes, grigio Portimao and nero Assen, whereas the Superpole graphic of the Tuono V4 1100 Factory has that decidedly non-conformist spirit so typical of the Aprilia stylistic tradition that demands bright and very distinctive colours.

Comments for this 2017 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber:
2017 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber
Moto Guzzi interprets the legendary Bobber style, essential and aggressive: the chrome-plating leaves room for matte tones; the bobbed seat shows the mudguard; and the high-walled tires underline the grit of a true Bobber. The 850cc 90 degree transverse V-twin, cardan transmission and steel frame display the essence of Moto Guzzi in a Bobber version. The quality metal mudguards provide room for the imposing tires that deserve display with pride. The steel tank is painted in a dark matte color, enlivened by checkered graphics that underlines the sporty spirit of V9 Bobber. To ride in total safety, ABS and traction control come standard.
What is meant by authenticity? It means knowing how to live according to what we really are and want without being influenced by what everyone else does.
Anchored to the road and in full control, stability and safety. V9 Bobber puts a wide rear tire and a formidable 130/90 front tire on the pavement.

2022 KTM 200 Duke
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT
Thanks to an ultra-compact single-cylinder 4-stroke power plant and a lightweight tubular chassis, the KTM 200 DUKE packs a mighty punch. An updated predatory design proudly displays its BEAST-inspired DNA and shouts DUKE. Make no mistake - the KTM 200 DUKE is an out-and-out street prowling brawler.
Features may include:ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Powered by a powerful single-cylinder engine, the KTM 200 DUKE not only delivers intoxicating acceleration but also everyday rideability. Boasting 19 kW (26 hp), it's the most powerful 4-stroke option in its class. Thanks to an updated airbox and exhaust, it meets the highest emission and noise standards, while providing maximum performance.CHASSIS
Upside-down fork
The KTM 200 DUKE comes with ultra-lightweight, high-performance upside-down WP forks as standard. Using the latest technology, these forks not only perform flawlessly when pushed to the limit, but also allow riders to cruise comfortably on longer stretches of tarmac.ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Seats
The two-part seat offers first class sport riding ergonomics with maximum support for both rider and pillion.BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Design
There's no denying the KTM 200 DUKE is 100% DUKE. Its aggressive-looking headlight, READY TO RACE stance and sharp lines make it a formidable presence on any street.SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
ABS
Single channel BOSCH ABS comes as standard on the KTM 200 DUKE. This means you can ride assured knowing that should you have to brake hard and suddenly - the DUKE has your back.

(SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY!)

Meticulously maintained 2017 YZ250F. This bike has been cared for like a child. Heated/cooled shop kept, deep clean and dry after every ride, oil change every two rides (filter at 4). Could talk about this beast for days but Ill just list the highlights:

- GYTR Ported Cylinder Head w/airbox and intake assembly (uses VP U4.4 fuel)
- Complete FMF Exhaust System (GYTR Mega Bomb header, F4.1 slip)
- RG3 fork suspension springs
- Excel Takasago Rims
- Devol Transformer Suspension Pull Rod
- TMD Factory Chain Guide
- New Sunstar Factory front and back Sprockets and Chain
- Works Connection Holeshot Kit, skid plate, radiator guards, and more
- Flo Factory Pro Pegs
- Nekken bars
- Brand new Dunlop MX33 Front and Back Tires
- New front and back wheel bearings
- Brand new top end with high compression piston and rings with heat cycle complete

Comes with the original stock cylinder head (w/ 15 hours on it), complete stock exhaust system, extra clutch plates, stock pull rod, and 2 very lightly used Wiseco High Compression pistons with plenty of life left, a lightly used MX 53 back tire and all the extra blue and black plastics you can handle(most of which are Cycra Powerflow). A little over 100hrs total on the bike (not the engine).

This bike needs absolutely nothing and is a complete powerhouse with all the looks to go with it. Literally load it up, take it to the track, and let it rip. The amount of time, care, and love dedicated to this bike into making it a horsepower dream combined with the extras that comes with it does not do this price justice. I am NOT interested in trades and low ballers will be ignored. I dont need to sell this bike as I LOVE IT, but these new 2 smokers are calling me.

I am selling my pair of Massimo MB200s for $600 for the pair, OBO. I originally paid $850 per bike in the summer of 2020. I am willing to negotiate on the price if the offer is within reason. I hate to see them go but I need the room in the garage and I rarely ride these days. They are definitely used! One of the bikes was in a minor crash that bent the forks and broke the faux gas tank. A new fork set about $150 on the Massimo website. The other one is missing a fender and has a hole in the seat cushion. The ideal buyer for these is someone who knows how to tool around on motorcycles. These bikes are a ton of fun to ride!

Here is the description from the website.

With classic styling and a time-proven design, the MB 200 evokes nostalgia of an era gone by. The single cylinder 6.5HP engine carries riders up to 24mph, and a low 24in seat height keeps it compact and manageable for riders up to 200lb. A faux gas tank provides enclosed storage for your trail necessities, and super wide 19in knobby tires provide grip on difficult terrain.

• 196cc four stroke single cylinder engine
• Automatic transmission with dry clutch chain drive
• Faux gas tank for closed storage
• Carbureted and air cooled
• Rugged 19"" AT tires
• Supports up to 200 lbs",gas,100.0,automatic,,fair,clean,198.0,,,other,,,,,

2014 Harley-Davidson® Tri Glide® Ultra
How much motorcycle can you fit on three wheels? One look at the new Tri Glide® Ultra Classic and you'll have your answer.
The 2014 Harley-Davidson® Trike motorcycles provide you long-haul comfort and confidence. As part of Project RushMore, for 2014 the Harley® Tri Glide® Ultra has been totally redesigned. The new twin-cooled high output Twin Cam 103™ engine is built to deliver more power for passing, climbing hills and carrying a passenger and luggage. There are new rear-to-front linked brakes for maximum stopping power. And the new Daymaker LED headlamp and LED fog lamps let you see farther than ever before. The new Boom Box 6.5 infotainment system features a 6.5 in full-color touch screen and the loudest, clearest speakers ever in a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle. The luggage spaces have been redesigned with more space inside, a sleek new look outside and new latches that can be operated with one hand. The iconic batwing fairing has also been changed to reduce head buffeting without losing its distinctive, authentic Harley-Davidson® style.
Features May Include:
Project RUSHMORE - Engine
As every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we’ve been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson® engine. The consensus was: We want more.
Pure Harley-Davidson® Styling
Feast your eyes on the Twin Cam 103™ engine and there's no mistaking its roots. This is authentic Harley-Davidson® style through and through with an attention to detail you won't find from any other motorcycle company. Black powder-coated cylinders and cylinder heads with machined cooling fin tips are topped off with chrome rocker covers, while chrome pushrods highlight the iconic V-Twin. It's a jewel machined out of metal. Pure. Dripping with power.
Six-Speed Cruise Drive® Transmission
You want a ride that rumbles—not begs for mercy—when you lean on it a little. The Six-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission provides smooth, quiet shifting and reduces engine speed on the highway, so you get a better match between engine turnover and road speed. It's a rare ride when a bike responds like this, and a low growl goes a long way when you're opening up the road ahead.
Twin Cam 103™ Engine Heritage
The knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103™ engine. We worked to perfect every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward. And we did it all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson®'s unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution®, Twin Cam 88® and Twin Cam 96™ engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two (or three) wheels.
Twin Cam 103™ Engine Innovation
Fire up the air-cooled, rubber-mounted Twin Cam 103™ engine and feel the low-end torque unleashed for a smooth ride. Thanks to the lightweight piston design, delivery of the added power is more refined than ever. Then put your foot on the shifter and feel how the engine and Six-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission were designed to work together. Six speeds. A strong driveline and strong internal parts.

Spring/summer is coming, and this bike is perfect for exploring all that Oregon has to offer!

Garaged most of it's life, it has been ridden gently/regularly and cared for by one owner since new-
and the charcoal silver paint is immaculate! 5 speed shifts like butter, and being belt driven means
less maintenance required! Comes with standard LED taillights and a USB port for phone charging.
Title in hand!

The only bad about the bike is that it has been on it's side 1 time - fortunately it was not running, or even moving;
a ""friend of mine"" (certainly couldn't have been me, I've been riding for 14 years!) lost his balance while pushing
it out of the garage- There was NO damage to the mirrors, clutch handle, handle bar, or pegs, just a minor scuff on
the left side of the bike / battery cover, as seen in the photos. Absolutely no impact on how it rides, or even looks!
Just being upfront here :)

This is a great motorcycle as a first, or even an experienced rider! plenty of power, yet manageable and non-threatening.
Please feel free to text me at (8 zero 3) 464 7 zero 16 with any questions, my name is Josh, and I'll be more than happy to answer them!

2023 Honda® CRF450RWE
FIFTY YEARS OF DOMINATION
When Honda introduced the first CR250M Elsinore fifty years ago, we changed motocross forever. And for 2023, we’re launching three new ways for you to dominate on the track: the CRF450R, the CRF450RWE, and the limited edition 50th Anniversary 450R trim. Updates include changes to the intake tract to give the engine more low- and midrange torque giving you faster corner exits and the ability to pull taller gears. The updated chassis is more robust at key points, resulting in better stability, optimized suspension performance, and improved handling. There’s even a new, stronger muffler.
And here’s the biggest news: To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first Honda Elsinore, we’re producing a special, limited run of the CRF450R complete with blue seat, gold handlebar and rims, commemorative graphics, and more.
Finally, there’s also our CRF450RWE (WE for Works Edition). It gets all the 2023 improvements plus special touches like a new, exclusive Yoshimura exhaust, Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey seat cover, Hinson clutch basket and cover, premium DID DirtStar LT-X rims, Kashima and titanium oxide-coated fork, a red cylinder head cover, and hands-on touches like special cylinder-head porting.
Features may include:HANDLING
LIGHT NARROW FRAME
Great handling starts with a superior frame, and that’s one place where the CRF450R chassis puts you out front. First, it’s light—over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation’s. By making the frame’s main spars narrow, we save weight, but more importantly we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.ENGINEERING
HYDRAULIC CLUTCH
The CRF450R features the first hydraulically actuated dirtbike clutch we’ve offered outside of our works bikes. Made by Nissin, it’s the same design as in our Grand Prix MX machines, and performs better than third-party conversions. You get a clutch-lever pull that’s ten percent lighter at its peak, even though it’s paired with an eight-plate clutch. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about making a clutch-cable adjustment, even during the longest events.CONVENIENCE
SEALED AIRBOX AND FILTER
Along with the special air filter, the airbox shape helps deliver more torque. You can access the airbox through the left number plate. And because the CRF450R’s filter has no rubber gasket where it interfaces with the intake boot, cleaning and servicing the filter is faster and less messy than ever.PERFORMANCE
EXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITION
Simply stated, the best of the best. The CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the standard CRF450R features, but also gets a special hand-ported cylinder head; Hinson clutch basket and cover; Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey graphics and seat cover; upgraded DID DirtStar LT-X rims; an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium midpipe and muffler; titanium oxide-coated lower fork legs; revalved suspension; an RK gold chain; special ECU settings; and black triple clamps. Available in extremely limited numbers.

The 2021 Honda CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP is a high-performance sport motorcycle that is powered by a 998cc inline-four engine. It features a lightweight and agile chassis, as well as advanced suspension and brake systems, to provide excellent handling and stability on the track. The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP comes equipped with a range of premium components and advanced electronics, including traction control, quick shifter, and adjustable rider modes, to enhance its performance and rider experience.

2021 Honda® CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP
EVERYTHING BUT THE FACTORY CONTRACT
What you see here is the best of the best, the most exclusive, feature-rich open-class sportbike Honda has ever built under the CBR banner. Introducing the limited edition CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP. Street legal, but track ready. Offering a degree of performance and refinement you’ve likely never experienced—unless you’ve had a factory ride. Available to only a handful of lucky riders. And it still offers Honda’s famous CBR refinement, build quality, and rideability. Get ready to find out why world champions like Marc Mrquez ride red. And why you should too.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
RC213V-SPEC BORE AND STROKE
All new bore and stroke (81mm x 48.5mm) are the same as Honda’s MotoGP Champion RC213V racebike, drawing on our experience with cylinder filling and combustion gathered on the track.
FINGER-FOLLOWER ROCKER ARMS
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP uses finger-follower rocker arms. The design reduces the inertia weight of the valve system by approximately 75% compared to a shim-and-bucket system, and contributes to the Fireblade SP’s higher redline. DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating reduces friction resistance on surfaces sliding against the cam and tappet shim.
TECHNOLOGY
FULL-COLOR TFT METER
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP is equipped with a larger instrument screen and higher resolution than previous CBR models. You can choose from a menu of screen setting options that display the information you want in a format you prefer, with items like engine temperature, riding modes, speedometer and tachometer, shifter setting, ABS level, gear position, remaining fuel, and much more.
TITANIUM CONNECTING RODS
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP uses titanium con rods, and the rod bolts thread directly into the rod body so there’s no separate fastening nut. The design reduces weight by approximately 50% compared to a steel rod, and is the same design as the RC213V-S rod.
HANDLING
HLINS SECOND-GENERATION SMART EC SUSPENSION
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP uses an electronically controlled NPX fork manufactured by hlins. By adding a pressurized damping system to the NIX fork used by the previous CBR1000RR SP, cavitation inside the damper is minimized to stabilize damping force more and improve bump absorption.
TWIN-SPAR FRAME
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP uses a light-weight aluminum frame with 2mm thick wall sections. Vertical and torsional rigidity have increased by 18% and 9% respectively, and horizontal rigidity decreased by 11% for better feel and performance.
DESIGN
TITANIUM MUFFLER
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP’s muffler was developed jointly with Akrapovic. It’s made out of titanium for light weight, and the design also contributes to the bike’s mass centralization. A special valve in the exhaust helps boost torque at lower revs and increase horsepower at higher rpm.
COMPACT OVERALL CHASSIS
The CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP’s wheelbase is just 57.3 inches for super-responsive handling, while the swing arm measures 24.5 inches in length. The crankshaft centerline is 33mm farther from the front axle and 16mm higher for better front/rear balance with a rider onboard. Rake angle is 24 degrees, with 101.2mm of trail.

2017 KTM 1290 Super Duke GT
ADRENALINE EXPRESS
The 1290 Super Duke R got us thinking. What if we could match The Beast’s interstellar performance to all day, two-up comfort? What if we would train the most dynamic naked bike ever to race any paved road the world has on offer? Regardless of the weather. Over and over again. So we brought out the big guns, aiming for state-of-the-art ergonomics, electronics and extreme stamina. The result is a long distance V-twin rocket that proudly roars past the top of the food chain, hungry for more. For miles. The faster, the better. A motorcycle that is equally happy hunting horizons, as it is chasing superbikes. And crushing them not only at cruising speeds. Welcome to the world of the 1290 Super Duke GT, where refinement, comfort, speed and ultimate performance rule.
Features may include:
WP SEMI-ACTIVE SUSPENSION
The innovative WP semi-active suspension system introduces a new level of comfort and safety in motorcycle riding. The rider can select three spectrums of use: ‘Comfort’, ‘Street’ and ‘Sport’, while the SCU (Suspension Control Unit) adapts the damping rates in real-time to the riding surface and rider, based on the information provided by a set of stroke sensors and accelerometers. It also reads the vehicle load, making the suspension suited to different weights.
FRAME AND SUBFRAME
The laser-cut, chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame, welded to the highest standards, contributes to excellent chassis geometry. It's extremely stable and weighs only 9.8 kg, which helps keep the overall weight down: 212 kg (ready to ride, without fuel) and 228 kg fully fueled and ready to race the sun.
SINGLE-SIDED SWINGARM
The jaw-droppingly beautiful, light alloy, single-sided swingarm on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is not only the lightest in its class, but also meticulously manufactured and generously dimensioned a reassuring partner when the Super Duke GT unleashes its full potential. The rear wheel is fitted to an axle that is 50 mm in diameter and bolted in place with a 60 mm central wheel nut. A high-precision, eccentric adjuster is used for tensioning the chain.
BRAKES
More than adequate deceleration is ensured at the front wheel by the two radially mounted Brembo M50 four-piston Monoblock calipers, actuated by a radial brake pump, each gripping onto floating 320 mm discs. The spacing between hand brake lever and handlebar is adjustable so that the lever is within easy reach for every rider. The front brake receives effective support from the disc brake on the rear wheel, which features a 240 mm diameter disc and a two-piston Brembo caliper. The enormous potential of the Brembo brakes can be exploited to the full thanks to its sportily tuned anti-lock braking system. The ABS even has a supermoto mode, for when you absolutely feel like backing it in while on holiday.
WHEELS AND TIRES
The Pirelli Angel GT’s on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT offer eager steering, with a broad grip range and fantastic stability. These tubeless sports tires are fitted on alloy rims manufactured in a low-pressure die casting process. Not only do these featherweight wheels make the bike lighter overall, they also minimize the unsprung masses and moment of inertia, with a positive impact on the handling and ride dynamics.
STEERING DAMPER
With so much propulsive power, the front wheel could become very light, which could quickly lead to unpleasant kick-back on uneven roads or following a slight stimulus at the handlebar. The Super Duke GT prevents this safely with a reliable and sensitive WP steering damper.

2017 Yamaha Stryker
STRYKES ALL THE RIGHT CHORDS
The looks and style you crave along with performance and refinement you only get from a Star Cruiser Line Motorcycle from Yamaha.
Features may include:
Real World Chopper Style
The look reinterprets classic custom chopper styling for an aggressive feel. High-end looks without the high-end price tag.
Potent Motor
Gutsy 1304cc, fuel-injected liquid-cooled V-Twin engine churns out the inspired, big-engine feel riders will love.
Agile Handling
Even with its radically raked out front end, Stryker® has the superbly nimble and lightweight handling that choppers and mid-class competitors can only dream about.
Low Seat Height
Low seat height (26.4 inches) allows riders to put both feet on the ground and helps provide this bike’s natural, relaxed and comfortable riding position.
Stylish Custom Wheels
Custom 5-spoke aluminum wheels carry a wide 210-series rear tire and chopper-inspired 21-inch front wheel that reinforce the muscular styling of the bike.
Real Steel Fenders
No cheap plastic fenders here—this authentic cruiser has real steel fenders customizers love. Classic belt drive, too.
Ready to Customize
Get started on your own customization with two trim packages in high-quality chrome, or an aggressive looking, blacked out package. The Star® Accessories Catalog is packed full of high-quality parts that invite Star owners to fully express their individuality.

Vehicle Comments:
Very clean! Must See The 2021 Honda Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES is a rugged and capable motorcycle designed for off-road adventures. It is equipped with a powerful 1,084cc engine, a durable chassis, and a range of advanced features, including electronic suspension, traction control, and a six-speed manual transmission.

2021 Honda® Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES
MAKE LIFE AN ADVENTURE
Has there ever been a better time to be an adventure-bike rider? And has taking your next vacation on an adventure bike ever looked better either? Honda’s Africa Twin lineup is so good it’s an embarrassment of riches. Technology. Comfort. Reliability you can count on, come rain or shine, continent-crossing journeys or weekend getaways. Features like cruise control and touch-screen technology make it a great tourer, while its rugged construction and off-road refinements let you wander from horizon to horizon on the path less travelled.
And best of all, there are four different Africa Twins to choose from. Our standard Africa Twin is a great choice for serious off-road enthusiasts. For long-distance adventure touring, check out our two Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES models: They offer special features like electronically controlled suspension, an adjustable windscreen, larger fuel tank, heated grips, tubeless tires, and more. Plus, both are available with either a manual transmission or Honda’s automatic DCT transmission, one of the best technical-riding advantages ever.
Features may include:
POWER
1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINE
The CRF1100L Africa Twin sports one of the best engines ever in an adventure bike. The parallel-twin design is narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. You’ll have more grunt down low, and cruise easy on the open road.
ENGINEERING
CRUISE CONTROL
Here’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the motorcycling world—Honda’s Africa Twins make great long-distance touring bikes. To that end, we’ve equipped our Africa Twin models with cruise control, just like our Gold Wings. Your next adventure really starts a couple of hundred miles away? No problem!
HANDLING
LONG-TRAVEL FRONT SUSPENSION
The Africa Twin doesn’t just look like an adventure bike—it’s the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel front suspension. The inverted Showa fork is fully adjustable with huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel—the most front-end travel in the 1000cc off-road class.
CONVENIENCE
Apple CarPlay™
Apple CarPlay™* seamlessly integrates your compatible iPhone®* into your new Africa Twin. That means you can use your iPhone® to access Apple Maps, Apple Music, and other services easily. You’ll have access to weather, playlists and telephone numbers while aboard. Available Bluetooth®**-enabled wireless headsets let you communicate more easily than ever. And best of all, with more apps available every day, Apple CarPlay™ keeps your bike’s technology and convenience on the cutting edge.

Nice Nice Nice - Incredible paint - Must See!

2012 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Seventy-Two®
The 2012 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Seventy-Two® XL1200V is a bare bones radical custom. From front to rear, the Seventy-Two® sports a bold, vintage look that recalls classic bobbers and the styling of 1970s choppers. With its big flake paint, peanut tank, round retro-style air-cleaner cover, ape-hanger handlebars, and brilliant whitewalls, the Sportster® Seventy-Two® boasts a one-of-a-kind custom style that's full of attitude. And the Seventy-Two® is uniquely priced to be an incredibly attractive value. No other bike in its class offers so much no-nonsense retro attitude and modern high-end style at such affordable cost. The Harley® Seventy-Two® is a masterful mix of vintage bobber and contemporary retro-chopper styling. Its powerful Evolution engine gives it impressive road muscle. The XL1200V's big-flake paint on the fuel tank is eye-catching, expressive, and of the highest Harley-Davidson® quality. Forward-mounted controls make the Seventy-Two® XL1200V comfortable for cruising across town. The Harley-Davidson® XL1200V is an attractively priced bike that brings the best of modern chrome-and-bling appeal to an aggressive, old-school chopper attitude. The Seventy-Two® screams high-end custom, at a price that makes the it truly accessible.
Features may include:
RETRO AIR CLEANER COVER
This 8-inch, street legal, mirror-chrome air cleaner cover makes a powerful statement that recalls the glory days of old iron crossed with a clean, contemporary look.
WHITEWALL TIRES AND LACED WHEELS
Large (21-inch front) lace-spoked wheels with their bold brilliant white walls complete the old school low-rider look.
CLASSIC PEANUT FUEL TANK
First appearing on a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle back in 1948, the small 2.1 gallon tapered peanut fuel tank holds strong today with its traditional styling and modern attitude. A low, powerful bulldog look that gives way for showcasing more engine, the peanut fuel tank is attitude and looks all balled up into one.

MINI-APE HANGER HANDLEBAR
Grab ahold of the stainless steel mini-ape hanger handlebar and put your fists up into the wind--it'll take you back to the glory days of chopper cruising. And to keep the look cool and clean, the wiring is routed inside the steel.

Vehicle Comments:
Fresh low mile trade here at Hillsboro Motosport. Barely used, bone stock, body has no visible blemishes anywhere. Tires look great too. Overall a must see if you are in the market for a large cc adventure bike.

2022 KTM 1290 Super Adventure S
Covering ground quickly and effortlessly is what the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S is made for. An Adventure-specced 1,301 cc V-Twin means that entire cross-country journeys are dispatched easily, while Adaptive Cruise Control and Semi-active Suspension together with reworked rider-focussed ergonomics and technology bring agility and long distance comfort to an entirely new level. It's a bold claim, but we'll make it - the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S is the new benchmark.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
With a sledgehammer hit of power and earth-twisting torque, the proven V-twin LC8 engine once again takes the accolades as the most compact, lightest, and best performing engine in the segment. Its greener too, and will deliver 15,000 km service intervals and low fuel consumption, trip after trip, mile after mile.
CHASSIS
Frame
A new, reworked, and lightweight, chrome-molybdenum stainless steel trellis frame featuring laser-cut tubes, combines with forged elements for an ultra-strong component on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S. The steering head has been moved 15 mm rearwards, to shorten the overall frame for improved cornering behavior, while the front engine mount has been rotated forward by 2 degrees to aid in hard acceleration, keeping the front end firmly planted on the ground. A newly designed, lightweight, and high-strength aluminum side stand completes the package.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
Wide, adjustable, and ready for long hours in the saddle, the high-strength tapered aluminum handlebars are designed to provide riders with greater control, and uncompromised comfort. Newly developed and robust handguards have also been designed for optimal aerodynamic behavior when it comes to high-speed stability.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
LED Headlight
Turning night into day, the new cornering integrated LED headlight has been designed to integrate the front Radar Sensor on the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S, flanked by cornering and day time running lights. This results in a clean, KTM-distinctive look which provides impeccable illumination with a wide beam pattern to light up the road ahead.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Taking charge at the helm is an all-new scratch-resistant 7-inch TFT display. Unmatched in terms of graphics and readability, adventurers can access information and make adjustments to the bike's semi-active suspension on the fly, quickly and easily without navigating complex menus. This comes thanks to a 6-way switch cube on the handlebar. Connectivity is also taken care of by way of KTM MY RIDE, which connects via Bluetooth for turn-by-turn navigation, playing music, and even answering incoming calls. Still catching glare? The TFT screen is tilt-angle adjustable.

2013 Kawasaki KX™ 450F
The KX™450F has been updated for 2013 to help continue its back-to-back string of recent championships. The string began with Monster Energy® Kawasaki®’s Ryan Villopoto winning both the 2011 Supercross and 2011 Motocross titles, followed by leading the U.S. team to an overall victory at the Motocross of Nations, then Villopoto’s absolute domination of the Monster Energy Cup —which also earned him the Monster Million. Last but not least, Villopoto recently defended his Supercross title by winning the 2012 championship on his KX™ 450F!

clean gsx.....stock.....6500 miles....needs nothing, just a new owner!!

2015 Suzuki GSX-S750Z
The original Suzuki GSX-R750 was designed as a street-legal bike that was born on the circuit. The 2015 Suzuki GSX-S750 gives that championship-winning heritage even more street-smart performance. Blending just the right mix of modern sportbike performance with futuristic streetbike style, this 750 is purpose-built for excitement.
Suzuki took the powerful 749cc four-cylinder fuel-injected sportbike engine from the GSX-R750, and tuned it to deliver the perfect power curve for street riding. The engine’s cam profiles have been revised, and the intake and exhaust tracts have been reshaped to boost low-end torque and mid-range power. This gives the 750 unmatched throttle response and intense acceleration. Suzuki dual-throttle valve fuel injection means the performance is crisp and consistent.
Handlebars replace the race bike’s clip-ons, delivering a more upright streetbike style. A complete instrument cluster features adjustable brightness, plus and analog tachometer, a digital LCD speedometer, plus a fuel-consumption meter, gear position indicator, fuel gauge, odometer/trip meter and a clock. The GSX-S750Z comes unique with gold-anodized front fork outer tubes, red-anodized front fork spring adjuster bolts, a matte silver handlebar, red rear suspension spring, and a blue drive chain.
Features May Include
Powerful 749cc 4-cylinder fuel-injected engine is tuned to deliver a dynamic wave of smooth torque and strong acceleration.
Automatic Idle Speed Control (ISC) improves cold starting and stabilizes engine idle while also reducing cold-start emissions.
Suzuki Exhaust Tuning (SET) servo-controlled butterfly valve helps enhance torque, response and acceleration, especially at low-to-mid rpm range.
Throttle bodies with Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) system contribute to cylinder charging efficiency and combustion efficiency for better throttle response and torque at the low to mid rpm range.
State-of-the-art transistorized digital ignition system contributes to a more complete combustion by igniting the mixture at the precise instant.
Iridium type spark plugs provide a more condensed and hotter spark yet last longer.
Inverted KYB front forks feature a design developed in racing and that is mandatory on a serious, high-performance machine.
Frame design combines the advantages of a compact tubular girder streetbike frame and a twin-spar sportbike frame to deliver a dynamic ride. A sport riding position is created by a carefully crafted relationship between the handlebars, footrests and seat.
Dual front brakes with fully-floating 310mm discs and dual-piston calipers. 240mm rear disc brake with single-piston caliper.
Link-type rear suspension, with a single rear shock absorber working through a progressive linkage. Spring preload is 7-way adjustable.
Carefully sculpted aggressive front bodywork and side pieces with highlights including a vented front fender, molded mirrors, chiseled fuel tank, textured tank side panels, and an angular tail section with integrated LED taillight. Bright and distinctively shaped headlight with a 60/55W halogen bulb.
Integrated dual position lights with patterned blue lenses.
A compartment underneath the removable passenger seat can carry a U-shaped lock or can be used to store small items.
Brightness-controllable instrument cluster, featuring a prominent analog tachometer and a large, digital LCD speedometer readout. The LCD display also includes a gear-position indicator, coolant temperature gauge, fuel gauge, selectable odometer/dual-tripmeter/fuel consumption meter and a clock.
12-month limited warranty.

2016 Honda® Fury
Furious.
When was the last time you saw a beige motorcycle? Motorcycling has never been about blending in or being one of the herd, and that’s especially true in the world of cruisers and customs. But we think a bike has to work as good as it looks, and that’s what really sets the Honda Fury® apart. Wanna turn some heads? The Fury® is guaranteed to do that. But it’s also for riders who want a machine that they can cruise on all day long, that doesn’t spend its life in the service bay. Long, lean and mean, stretching nearly six feet from axle to axle, this is an outrageous testimony to the builder’s art. And the power and sound coming from its big 1312cc V-twin? Pure music. With clean, crisp lines few customs ever achieve, the Fury® is as eye-catching when it’s stopped as when it’s rolling down the highway. One ride, and you’ll be hooked.
Features May Include:
1300cc V-Twin Engine
A powerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.
Fuel Injection
Forget about fiddling with a choke—the Fury®'s fuel-injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes.
Exhaust
The Fury®’s engine features specially designed camshafts that also add to the unique V-twin sound and power-pulse exhaust sensations.
Shaft Final Drive
The shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.
Brakes
A single, powerful 336mm-diameter front-disc brake is complemented by a 296mm brake disc in back. An ABS version is also available.
Unique Wheels and Tires
A fat 200-series rear tire is paired with a slim 21-inch front tire, both wrapped around distinctive alloy wheels.
High-Tensile Steel Frame
The Fury®’s high-tensile steel frame is the centerpiece to this machine’s open, minimalist chopper styling. It’s functional, too, delivering smooth ride quality and responsive handling.
Long Rake
A raked-out front end and condensed, hard-tail look to the rear, plus a stretched wheelbase. And that long wheelbase is no illusion—the Fury® stretches a full 71.2 inches between axles.
Chopper Styling
The Fury® is one of the most authentic, radically styled custom motorcycles that Honda has ever produced. It features a teardrop seamless fuel tank, an ingenious single-shock rear suspension system and an aluminum swingarm.
Low Seat
The Fury®'s super-low 26.7-inch seat height is an integral design element that fits in behind the slim and long fuel tank.

2022 Kawasaki KLX®300SM
GET OUT AND PLAY
The KLX®300SM ultimate lightweight supermoto motorcycle takes the fun to the streets in full supermoto style. A quick-accelerating engine, paired with light, agile handling, evokes the playfulness within. Suspension, wheels, and brakes are optimized for supermoto, and the overall aggressive styling means business. The KLX®300SM is quick to steal the scene with equal parts performance and attitude.
Features may include:
POWER AND PERFORMANCE
DELIVER THE EXCITEMENT
The KLX®300SM ultimate lightweight supermoto motorcycle is powered by a 292cc, fuel-injected, liquid-cooled engine. Experience a rewarding spread of power across the rev range. Smooth power delivery and crisp throttle response helps riders of all skill levels maneuver through stop-and-go city traffic, navigate country back roads, or experience the exhilaration of supermoto racing at their local track. Electric start offers easy starting; fuel injection helps with reliable starting in a wide range of conditions and contributes to improved fuel economy.
SUPERMOTO-TUNED PERFORMANCE
TAKE THE FUN TO THE STREETS
The KLX®300SM motorcycle is built with a slim, lightweight perimeter frame that’s maneuverable but rigid at higher speeds to help with straight-line stability. With the smaller front wheel, the caster angle (25°) and short wheelbase contribute to quick handling. Suspension performance offers 9.1 inches of travel up front and 8.1 inches in the rear, ideal for supermoto riding. The 43mm inverted cartridge-style front fork has adjustable compression damping to optimize fork performance for conditions and personal preference. The Uni-Trak® rear suspension offers bump absorption and rebound damping adjustability, and fully adjustable preload, allowing riders to tailor shock settings to personal preference. Substantial braking power comes thanks to a large 300mm semi-floating petal disc and twin-piston caliper up front and a 240mm petal rear disc and single-piston caliper. Agile supermoto performance is further enabled with 17-inch wheels and road tires contributing to better handling on the street.
COMFORTABLE ERGONOMICS
MAKE COMFORT A PRIORITY
An upright and relaxed riding position makes it comfortable to ride the KLX®300SM motorcycle. Rider-friendly ergonomics are complemented by a thick-padded seat, rubber dampened footpegs, and a 33.9-inch seat height that allows riders to comfortably reach the ground at stops which increases confidence. The innovative radiator fan directs hot air down and away from the rider and from high touch areas for added comfort in traffic.
SUPERMOTO STYLE
ALL ATTITUDE. NO APOLOGIES.
The aggressive supermoto-inspired bodywork on the race-inspired KLX®300SM motorcycle delivers performance and attitude. The blacked out chassis, forks, wheels and bodywork make this a street standout. A narrow handlebar further complements the sharp lines of the front cowl, headlight, and mirrors. From the cockpit, all-digital instrumentation is on display, including a digital speedometer, bar-type tachometer, clock, odometer, dual trip meters, and a range of warning/indicator lamps.
ADDITIONAL VEHICLE
Strong low-end and mid-range power
Powerful petal disc brakes
Comfortable ergonomics
Heat management for rider comfort
Aggressive supermoto styling
All-digital multi-function instrumentation

2023 Honda® Rebel 500
UNLEASH YOUR INNER REBEL
Rebels are the ones who refuse to compromise, just like the Rebel 500 refuses to choose between power, precision and style. It’s able to deliver all three in excess, thanks to the timeless cruiser styling, a lean twin-cylinder engine and user-friendly powerband. While contemporary features like a full LED lighting package, our Honda slipper/assist clutch and optional anti-lock braking system make for an uncompromising ride down the straights as well as the twisties. New colors for this year will pair perfectly with your favorite gear or accessories, helping you personalize a modern cruiser that refuses to be ignored. Or check out the Rebel 500 ABS Special Edition for a model that comes complete with our most popular accessories, like the diamond-stitch seat and headlight cowl.
Features may include:
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self-expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower, and the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCH
Developed and perfected in Honda racing machines, the slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus, it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.

2023 KTM 690 SMC R
The KTM 690 SMC R raises the bar in the supermotos stakes, thanks in part to a lightweight chassis, a legendary 690 LC4 motor and a sophisticated electronics package. Whether you express your tarmac-sliding talent on mountain roads or on the apexes of your favourite track, you'll be drifting into the future with a maxed-out grin and your veins coursing with adrenaline. Handling is enhanced by the latest fully-adjustable WP APEX suspension, so all you have to worry about is focusing on the road ahead and twisting the throttle to the stoppers.
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The LC4 690 cc single-cylinder engine combines powerful acceleration from the very lowest revs with an outstanding free-revving nature and refined engine running. Another big plus is besides the engine being extremely economical with fuel it also has long service intervals of 10,000 km, keeping running costs low.
Cylinder head
A lightweight, compact cylinder head contains four valves and a single camshaft placed over the intake valves, and a secondary balancer shaft driven by the timing chain. The intake valves are actuated by finger followers and the exhaust valves by a rocker arm.
Exhaust
The KTM 690 SMC R features a precisely developed exhaust system made from the highest-quality stainless steel and is emissions compliant too. However, should you want a little more 'grunt', the KTM PowerParts catalog features a collection of READY TO RACE hardware to take your KTM 690 SMC R to the next level.
CHASSIS
Frame
The trellis frame is manufactured from lightweight sections of top-quality chrome-molybdenum steel tubing of varying thicknesses. This type of balanced frame design provides high torsional rigidity for best handling and rideability, while a more specifically-tuned longitudinal flexibility can absorb the wheel impact energy, supporting the suspension for reduced rider fatigue.
Subframe
Tried and trusted - the effective use of the rear fuel tank as the main structural element of the subframe, keeps weight low and eliminates design complexity.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
The lightweight tapered 808 mm wide handlebars are rubber mounted to reduce vibrations. Their width and shape are aimed at providing optimum control in all situations.
Footpegs
The slim profile needed for maximum lean angle is helped by short footrests, while a removable rubber insert ensures comfort with street boots.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Rider aids
Electronic fuel injection, ride-by-wire and the engine management system (EMS) make it possible to offer innovative yet easy-to-use electronic rider aids. These features can be selected, deselected and utilized to put the potent new-generation LC4 motor to effective use across a much wider range of streets, surfaces and conditions.
Ride modes
Two ride modes (1) Street mode (2) Supermoto mode: ""Street mode"" for sporty throttle response where wheel slip and wheelies are kept to a minimum for optimal street performance. ""Supermoto mode"", by contrast, produces smooth throttle response with Supermoto Traction Control, which allows wheel slip and front wheel lifting without hindering performance. The modes are easily switched over from the handlebar, making adjustment to the character of the engine possible on the fly. Traction control can be disabled if needed.

2023 KTM 690 Enduro R
Ride from home and feel the adrenaline build while chasing tarmac curves towards your favourite offroad location. No trailer required just twist the throttle of the KTM 690 ENDURO R, which really comes into its own when the dirt begins and the trail gets more extreme. Its lightweight chassis, aggressive styling, and trusted 690 LC4 motor, are enhanced by the latest electronics and WP XPLOR suspension. Master more challenging terrain on this lightweight, high-performance king of versatility.
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The engine combines powerful acceleration from the very lowest revs with an outstanding free-revving nature and refined engine running. Another big plus: It's extremely economical with fuel.
Cylinder Head
A lightweight, compact cylinder head contains four valves and a single camshaft placed over the intake valves, with a secondary balancer shaft driven by the timing chain. The intake valves are actuated by finger followers and the exhaust valves by a rocker arm.
Exhaust
The KTM 690 ENDURO R features a specifically developed exhaust system made from the highest-quality stainless steel, which is not only compact and optimized for offroad use, it is emissions compliant too.
CHASSIS
MASTER THE RIDE
Frame
The trellis frame is manufactured from lightweight sections of top-quality chrome-molybdenum steel tubing of varying thicknesses. This type of balanced frame design provides high torsional rigidity for best handling and rideability, while a more specifically-tuned longitudinal flexibility can absorb the wheel impact energy, supporting the suspension for reduced rider fatigue.
Subframe
The innovative use of the rear fuel tank as the main structural element of the subframe, keeps weight low and eliminates design complexity.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
The lightweight tapered 808 mm wide handlebars are rubber mounted to reduce vibrations. Their width and shape are aimed at providing maximum control in all situations.
Footpegs
Sophisticated ""No Dirt"" foot pegs prevent jamming up of the pegs, even when digging your way through deep ruts or navigating wet terrain. Rubber inserts can be mounted for street use to help reduce any vibration that might be felt through the pegs on smooth roads.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Dashboard
Keeping true to its enduro roots, the KTM 690 ENDURO R sports a simple, but effective dashboard. Providing riders with essential information its slimline design keeps the view forward clear of any obstructions. After all, when you're blasting across challenging terrain, you don't want any distractions.
Rider aids
Electronic fuel injection, ride-by-wire and the engine management system (EMS) make it possible to offer innovative yet easy-to-use electronic rider aids. These features can be selected, deselected and utilized to put the potent new-generation LC4 motor to effective use in a much wider range of terrain types and conditions.

Ultra Low Miles - Incredibly Nice - A must see - Potent Power - 600cc Honda Sport Bike.

2022 Honda® CBR600RR
PERFORMANCE AT ITS BEST
Sportbikes—especially 600-class machines—are for riders who want to feel the highest degree of connection with their motorcycles. Because the greater the connection, the more rewarding the ride. And that’s why we strive to make our Honda CBR600RR models as good as they are. The high-revving inline-four engine is instantly responsive. The aluminum chassis and premium suspension precisely connect you with the road like nothing else. And only a 600 can give you the light, crisp handling so many sportbike riders find so attractive. Available with optional anti-lock brakes, the CBR600RR is the best example of a highly refined breed. Is it for you? Ride one and see.
Features may include:
BRAKING
RADIAL MOUNTED FRONT-BRAKE CALIPERS
The CBR600RR uses radial-mounted monoblock front-brake calipers. This construction makes the caliper stiffer, and that means you get better brake feel for more linear, powerful stopping. Each caliper also uses four chromium-plated aluminum pistons for smooth, friction-free operation.
ENGINEERING
CENTRALLY LOCATED FUEL TANK
The CBR600RR’s 4.8-gallon fuel tank is positioned in the center of the chassis and low in the frame. This allows for a more compact design, but even more important helps centralize the bike’s mass. Increased mass centralization means the CBR is more responsive to rider input, especially when leaning the bike into a turn or standing it up at the exit.
HANDLING
Honda ELECTRONIC STEERING DAMPER (HESD)
Most steering dampers only sense handlebar-deflection speed. The Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) is way more sophisticated. It also detects vehicle speed, and adjusts damping proportionally. That helps maintain low-speed maneuverability while providing excellent, predictable high-speed handling.
PERFORMANCE
DUAL-STAGE FUEL INJECTION
Two sets of injectors per cylinder ensure both low- and high-rpm performance. You get near-instantaneous high-rpm response, along with great low-rpm metering and clean running.

2016 KTM 1290 Super Adventure
The Benchmark in the Travel Enduro Segment
The 1290 KTM Super Adventure is the clear benchmark in the travel enduro segment with a class-leading equipment specification that leaves other travel enduros playing catch-up. The Super Adventure's uncompromisingly powerful KTM engine is matched by safety and electronics packages that are streets ahead of the competition, which means that sports riding meshes seamlessly with a versatile travel enduro style, making the Super Adventure the perfect ride for any journey.
Features may include:
Cockpit
State-of-the-art instrument cluster from automotive supplier VDO: central permanent LCD for displaying all riding conditions (plus speedo, cruise control and rev counter with adjustable gearshift light), another LCD on the left for displaying the adjustable features:
Favourites page
MSC ride modes
WP Semi-active suspension mode
Heated grips and seats
Riding conditions page for additional info, e.g. outside/oil temperature, onboard voltage, various trips, average speed, average and current fuel consumption, range, distance to next service
Mode Switch
Different modes for the various assistance systems can be selected using a mode switch on the left side of the handlebar. It's very simple and intuitive: ""up"" and ""down"" through the menu selection, select the desired menu item with the left button, confirm it with the right, job done!
Chassis
With its ultra-lightweight yet extremely rugged tubular space frame, the high strength, die-cast, open-lattice swingarm and newly developed, semi-active suspension components from WP Suspension, the KTM 1290 Super Adventure’s chassis meets and exceeds every demand in terms of stability, delivering total control to the rider. Spoked wheels - tubeless, 19-inch up front; 17-inch at the rear - fat tires and tuned suspension travel further optimise its talents on the asphalt.

Vehicle Comments:
Heritage: Harley-Davidson is an iconic American motorcycle manufacturer with a rich history and loyal following. Buying a Harley can be an expression of the brand and what it stands for, Style: The Sportster Iron 1200 is a classic-looking motorcycle that harks back to the early days of American motorcycling. With its stripped-down, minimalist design, it has a timeless look that many riders find appealing. Riding experience: The Sportster Iron 1200 is powered by a air-cooled V-twin engine which is known for giving a good torque and power. This, combined with the bike's relatively low seat height and center of gravity, make it relatively easy to handle, especially for newer riders. Customizability: Harley-Davidson offers a wide range of parts and accessories to customize the Sportster Iron 1200 to an individual's taste, so you can make the bike truly your own. Price: Harley-Davidson Sportster models are relatively affordable when comparing to other models from the brand, which can be a good option for those looking for a Harley at a more accessible price point. Community: Buying a Harley-Davidson also means becoming part of a passionate and dedicated community of riders who share a love for the brand and the lifestyle it represents. Again, it's worth noting that these are some of the key selling points of this model, but every rider might have different priorities and preferences, it's always recommendable to test ride a motorcycle and evaluate if it meets your needs and preferences.

Nice

2015 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Iron 883™
This blacked-out bruiser is a raw, aggressive throwback. No apologies—just an authentic ride.
The 2015 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Iron 833™ model XL883N is an amazing way to get started with a custom bobber. From the authentic Harley® 883 cc engine to the chopped fenders to the peanut fuel tank, every piece of the Harley® Sportster® Iron 883™ model has the style you want in your custom bike. For 2015, it comes with a powerful new braking system, optional anti-lock brakes (ABS) and comfortable new ergonomic hand controls. For a combination of style and value look no further than the H-D® Iron 883™ model.
Features may include:
Side-Mounted License Plate
True to the clean, fast lines of the bike, the side-mounted license plate leaves the rear fender surface smooth and uncluttered. Minimal and unique—every inch of the Iron 883™ motorcycle is styled to perfection to achieve a raw, custom look.
Evolution® Engine Heritage
The Evolution® engine—known in certain crowds as the Blockhead—was first bolted to the frame of a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle back in 1984. Born from legendary Shovelhead and Ironhead engines, the Evolution® engine broke new ground in displacement innovation while maintaining the hunger for power, durability and proven reliability that The Motor Company was built on.
H-D® Smart Security System (Optional)
The factory-installed next-generation security system features a hands-free fob that automatically arms and disarms the vehicle's electronic security functions as you approach and walk away from the bike. Stick the fob on your ignition key ring and let it do all the work. It's this attention to detail and security that make Harley-Davidson® motorcycles unique.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7 inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. A responsive ride for whipping through town or busting out onto the interstate.
Mid-Mounted Controls
Let your boots fall where they may, naturally to the mid-mounted controls and rider foot pegs on the Iron 883™ model. An easy reach and tight rider triangle is confidence-inspiring for new riders eager to set off on their journey and riders whose legs run slightly shorter than others.

TRACER 9 GT...DOHC...ALL NEW 890CC...LIQUID COOLED...3 CYLINDER...AND MORE
2021 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.Features may include:
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled 3-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The 2021 Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled 3-cylinder, DOHC, 4-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore × stroke of 78 mm × 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900’s frame is 3.5 mm).ENGINE
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the 2021 Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.
Lightweight Forged Pistons
The lightweight forged pistons allow for smooth, high-revving power.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Strong Steel Subframe
The 2021 Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.
Redesigned Lightweight, High-Rigidity Swingarm
The Tracer 9 GT features a new, longer swingarm that is now located inside of the frame. It has a boxed construction formed by welding together aluminum plates. The new swingarm helps achieve both high rigidity and lighter weight, conveying the feeling of drive force to the rider and aiding with excellent traction at high speeds and when cornering.

2019 KTM 500 EXC-F
THE ALPHA
The KTM 500 EXC-F is undoubtedly the most powerful competition enduro bike available. Its dominant power is tightly packaged in a cutting-edge chassis to keep things civilized, allowing riders to reign in all of its horses over the toughest terrain. All it takes is a twist of the throttle to realize that this in no ordinary big-bore enduro bike. It's THE ULTIMATE big-bore competition enduro bike.Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
When it comes to blasting up the steepest climbs or shredding off down loamy single-tracks, KTM produces a range of sophisticated 4-strokes to Enduro faster than ever. Their lightweight and compact design ensures nimble agility in the tighter sections, while also delivering incredible enduro-specific torque to launch up the next rocky hill with pro-like ease.
CHASSIS
For 2019, all KTM EXC-F models continue with their compact and lightweight approach. This now means the 500 EXC-F is not only the most powerful KTM dirt bike, but also the leanest, meanest 500 cc in its class.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
READY TO RACE ergonomics developed over many years of offroad domination ensure 500 EXC-F pilots always have perfect maneuverability on the bike, while maintaining full control.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
KTM R&D, KISKA Design and KTM factory racers have collaboratively shaped the plastics and decals on the 2019 KTM enduro range. The mandate was simple - create complete harmony between rider and bike, keep the weight down and ensure KTM's READY TO RACE spirit is felt both on and off the bike.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
The 500 EXC-F shares the same fuel injection and sophisticated traction control technology as the rest of the 2019 4-stroke weapons.

2022 Husqvarna® TC 250
Pure intensity
The TC 250 comfortably holds the top step in the 250 cc 2-stroke motocross class. Featuring the latest in 2-stroke motocross technology and delivering the highest level of performance and quality. Paired with modern bodywork, advanced ergonomics and premium parts standard, the TC 250 promises superior comfort and control in all riding conditions.
For 2022 we upgraded the hydraulic clutch to an all new high-performance Brembo system for perfect modulation at all times. On top, striking new dark blue and white graphics stylishly adorn the Swedish inspired design.
Features may include:
Performance
ENGINE
The 250cc 2-stroke engine is the ultimate combination of unsurpassed power and lightweight construction. The simplicity and low maintenance cost of the 2-stroke motor makes it a favorite amongst motocross riders.
Cylinder
The 66.4mm bore cylinder features an innovative power valve system which delivers smooth and controlled power throughout the RPM range. This can be further customized by simply changing two springs supplied and altering the power delivery for different track conditions or rider preference.
Chassis
CHROMIUM-MOLYBDENUM FRAME
Precision engineered for an exact balance of stiffness and torsional flex, the frame features advanced geometries aimed at delivering accurate rider feedback, handling response, energy absorption and straight-line stability. The frame is finished off in a premium blue powder coating and standard frame protectors for superior protection and durability.
Carbon fibre subframe
Made from 70% polyamide and 30% carbon fiber, the unique subframe features an intelligent 2-piece design delivering exceptional strength and durability at an overall weight of just over 1 kg (2.2 lb). Specific care is taken to create the perfect rigidity for optimal handling and rider comfort.
Control
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
The 48 mm split air fork features a capsulated air spring and pressurized oil chamber for progressive and consistent damping. Extended oil and air bypasses reduce pressure peaks and 300mm cartridges and outer tubes provide refined rigidity. In combination with a midvalve damping system, the fork provides exceptional feedback and rider comfort. The setting is easily adjusted via the single air pressure pre-load valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. Additionally, the air pump needed to adjust the fork's air pressure is provided as standard.
WP XACT REAR SUSPENSION
With updated settings, the WP XACT rear shock provides advanced damping characteristics for unsurpassed traction and energy absorption. A pressure balance inside the shock ensures consistent damping, resulting in superior rider comfort and feeling.
Technology
COMPONENTS
The most progressive engineering techniques and technology complement a long list of quality componentry standard on the TC 250.
ProTaper handlebar
Featuring fatigue resistance at a minimal weight, the standard ProTaper handlebars are manufactured to exacting standards to deliver exceptional rider comfort and control.

2023 Honda® GROM
GROM-IT!
The Honda Grom is one of the most popular motorcycles on the p t, and one ride will tell you why. And even when you’re not riding one, a Grom is just fun to own. They’re a vehicle for self expression in so many different ways. But what always stays the same is the dependability and quality you can count on with every Honda and every Grom. That starts with the 124cc electric-start engine. Fuel injection and a 10:1 compression ratio contribute to the awesome fuel efficiency—a crazy-good 166 miles per gallon!* A five-speed transmission works just like a bigger motorcycle’s for excellent performance. And the plug-and-play body panels are easy to remove if you want to add some custom graphics of your own—it’s like a blank canvas that you can ride. There’s even a version with optional anti-lock brakes. Hey, everyone has someplace to go—why not have fun doing it? Get there on a Grom.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
124cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINE
Nobody can match our reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it’s a giant in terms of performance and reliability.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
At just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the seat features thick padding so it’s comfortable, especially for taller riders.
ENGINEERING
HYDRAULIC DISC BRAKES
The Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.
STYLE
UNIQUE BODYWORK
Part of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. Plus, its unique bodywork is easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.
LED HEADLIGHT
The Grom’s LED projector-style headlight not only looks great and is a major styling element, but it also provides excellent illumination.

2023 GASGAS ES 700
A playful single-cylinder, dual-sport performer, the ES 700 is a big-bore bike that's perfect for mixed surface riding. Branching out into the street bike sector and creating the ES 700 GASGAS, we utilized in-house expertise, fresh thinking, and cutting-edge technology to produce a bike that delivers a distinct and playful riding experience. All the power from the single-cylinder, 692.7cc motor is delivered through a super-cool ride-by-wire throttle system, which guarantees a crisp throttle response and gives a highly accurate delivery of the motor's linear power. The bike is also loaded with the latest in electronic rider aids, which allows you to fine-tune the ES 700 to be just the way you like it. And with a state-of-the-art ABS system, and Brembo brakes, you'll always be in control. And, if that isn't enough, the ES 700 boasts incredibly long service intervals of 10,000 kilometers, so you can rack up some serious distance in between trips to your local dealer.
Features may include:
STYLE
YOUR DAILY RIDE
The ES 700 features unique ergonomics that ensure maximum enjoyment and a very special riding experience. Turning every road and offroad track into a series of ongoing playgrounds, the lively handling and offroad inspired centered riding position inspires confidence and inject fun into every ride. Loaded with personality, each model stands loud and proud with its bold red look.
BODYWORK
So, so red! No one will miss you coming on the ES 700 thanks to the vibrant red body work and bold graphics. Inspired by our awesome off-road range, as well as being ergonomically top-notch, all panels wrap neatly around the frame and motor to improve the connection between rider and bike for total control in all situations.
HANDLING
EXCEPTIONAL HANDLING
Serious, all-in trail and street riding, that's what the GASGAS ES 700 is built for. And the exact reason why the ES 700 has exceptional handling, which allows riders of all ability levels to feel secure and super-confident, no matter where they're riding. From the steel trellis frames that ensure the perfect mix of flex and rigidity, to our super-strong, great looking, die-cast swingarms, and not forgetting the 3.6-gal (13.5-liter) fuel tanks that keep weight low, our street bikes deliver great handling. Finished with vibrant red bodywork, as well as being ergonomically top-notch, all panels wrap neatly around the frame and motor to improve the connection between rider and bike.
FRAME
Flex. Rigidity. Fun. The three most important things when it comes to our lightweight trellis frames. Designed to deliver razor sharp handling and stability, just the right amount of flex ensures an exhilarating ride on the ES 700, each and every time. Made from high-grade chromium-molybdenum steel to be super strong, precisely calculated torsional rigidity and longitudinal flex means riders of all abilities have the confidence to push harder, and ride further. They're robot welded too, to ensure accuracy and the very best quality, always. Oh, and they weigh just 18.5 lb (8.4kg).
POLYAMID SUBFRAME
We want everyone to get the most out of each ride, which is why the self-supporting rear subframe on the GASGAS ES 700 houses a 3.6-gal (13.5-liter) fuel tank. Molded from a single piece of high strength polyamide and weighing just 11.4 lb (5.2 kg), it's super tough and placed to keep weight as low as possible for best handling. Want to add either a dedicated mounting frame or passenger handles? No problem, we already thought of that!

Extended oil and air bypasses reduce pressure peaks and 300mm cartridges and outer tubes provide refined rigidity. In combination with a midvalve damping system, the fork provides exceptional feedback and rider comfort. The setting is easily adjusted via the single air pressure pre-load valve, as well as through easy access click adjusters for compression and rebound. Additionally, the air pump needed to adjust the fork's air pressure is provided as standard.
WP XACT REAR SUSPENSION
With updated settings, the WP XACT rear shock provides advanced damping characteristics for unsurpassed traction and energy absorption. A pressure balance inside the shock ensures consistent damping, resulting in superior rider comfort and feeling.
Technology
COMPONENTS
The most progressive engineering techniques and technology complement a long list of quality componentry standard on the TC 250.
ProTaper handlebar
Featuring fatigue resistance at a minimal weight, the standard ProTaper handlebars are manufactured to exacting standards to deliver exceptional rider comfort and control.

Low-mileage 2017 Ducati Monster 821 in classic Ducati Red, totally original except for a tail tidy with LED turnsignals, just got new fluids and a brand-new set of Continental tires so it needs nothing and is ready to ride into springtime! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2017 Ducati Monster 821 Red
Unmistakably Monster
112 HP Testastretta 11° engine, razor sharp handling, state of the art safety equipment,Riding Modes and unmistakable Ducati sound. Sport performance, Italian design and unique personality: Monster 821, essentially Monster.
*The power values indicated above are measured using a chassis dynamometer. Homologated power data, as quoted in the Bike Registration Document, are measured using an engine dynamometer according to the homologation regulation. The two power values may differ because of the different measurement equipments.
Concept
Forms and functionalities.
The performance and fluidity of the new Testastretta 11°, the versatility of the three Riding Modes, the comfort of the adjustable seat and the passenger handles make the Monster 821 the ideal bike for every occasion. With Monster, the design is unmistakably that of an icon. The fun has no limits.
Design
It takes just a glance to see all of the elements that contribute to creating the legendary Monster: the muscular, sporty line, the rounded front headlight flanked by the forks, the high number plate, the compact yet imposing metal fuel tank. The unmistakable ""minimalist"" design that gives you the impression of being in front of an engine, a frame, a tank, a seat, and nothing more.
Despite its larger size, which offers unprecedented performance and versatility, the Monster's proportions immediately reveal the heart of a sports bike. The mass is visually concentrated at the front and the engine area looks compact, even with the new water cooling system, into which the radiator and the water supply pipes have been cleverly incorporated. The engine is combined with an impressive side-mounted staggered exhaust system that leaves no room for doubt about the bike's performance.
The new Monster 821 clearly spells sophistication, modernity and substance thanks to its avant-garde technology and top-quality materials. Ducati's traditional trellis frame has evolved, using a typical sports bike solution, in which the engine is the supporting element. The imposing metal tank in pure ""Monster style"" helps to define a superior class of bike.
Testastretta 11°
The Monster 821 is powered by the Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine, with air injection system. A secondary air system similar to the one used on the 1199 Panigale has been introduced in order to optimise operation and reduce combustion cycle variability, without affecting emissions. A controlled flow of clean air is injected into the exhaust pipe, enabling total oxidation of the hot exhaust gases, efficiently cutting hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide levels.
The Testastretta 11° engine fitted to the Monster 821 is an exclusive feature of these bikes and its structure has been engineered to be an integral element of the frame. In addition, the air filter and exhaust system have been designed to provide improved torque at low-medium engine speeds.
The Testastretta 11° 821 cc engine generates power equal to 82.4 kW (112CV) @ 9,250 rpm and 89.4 Nm (9.1kgm) of torque at 7,750 rpm.
Exhaust system
The Testastretta 11° 821 engine is combined with a type 2-1-2 exhaust system, which leaves no room for doubt about the performance that the new Monster 821 is capable of unleashing.
The engine control unit has a lambda probe for each individual cylinder, guaranteeing delivery of the right amount of fuel, while the stylish vertically stacked cannon silencers are equipped with catalytic converters that ensure compliance with Euro 4 standards. An electronically controlled mid-section adjustment valve optimises exhaust pressure according to engine speed.

2017 KTM 1290 Super Duke GT, the Super Duke goes touring! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2017 KTM 1290 Super Duke GT
ADRENALINE EXPRESS
The 1290 Super Duke R got us thinking. What if we could match The Beast’s interstellar performance to all day, two-up comfort? What if we would train the most dynamic naked bike ever to race any paved road the world has on offer? Regardless of the weather. Over and over again. So we brought out the big guns, aiming for state-of-the-art ergonomics, electronics and extreme stamina. The result is a long distance V-twin rocket that proudly roars past the top of the food chain, hungry for more. For miles. The faster, the better. A motorcycle that is equally happy hunting horizons, as it is chasing superbikes. And crushing them – not only at cruising speeds. Welcome to the world of the 1290 Super Duke GT, where refinement, comfort, speed and ultimate performance rule.
Features may include:
WP SEMI-ACTIVE SUSPENSION
The innovative WP semi-active suspension system introduces a new level of comfort and safety in motorcycle riding. The rider can select three spectrums of use: ‘Comfort’, ‘Street’ and ‘Sport’, while the SCU (Suspension Control Unit) adapts the damping rates in real-time to the riding surface and rider, based on the information provided by a set of stroke sensors and accelerometers. It also reads the vehicle load, making the suspension suited to different weights.
FRAME AND SUBFRAME
The laser-cut, chrome-molybdenum steel trellis frame, welded to the highest standards, contributes to excellent chassis geometry. It's extremely stable and weighs only 9.8 kg, which helps keep the overall weight down: 212 kg (ready to ride, without fuel) and 228 kg fully fueled and ready to race the sun.
SINGLE-SIDED SWINGARM
The jaw-droppingly beautiful, light alloy, single-sided swingarm on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is not only the lightest in its class, but also meticulously manufactured and generously dimensioned – a reassuring partner when the Super Duke GT unleashes its full potential. The rear wheel is fitted to an axle that is 50 mm in diameter and bolted in place with a 60 mm central wheel nut. A high-precision, eccentric adjuster is used for tensioning the chain.
BRAKES
More than adequate deceleration is ensured at the front wheel by the two radially mounted Brembo M50 four-piston Monoblock calipers, actuated by a radial brake pump, each gripping onto floating 320 mm discs. The spacing between hand brake lever and handlebar is adjustable so that the lever is within easy reach for every rider. The front brake receives effective support from the disc brake on the rear wheel, which features a 240 mm diameter disc and a two-piston Brembo caliper. The enormous potential of the Brembo brakes can be exploited to the full thanks to its sportily tuned anti-lock braking system. The ABS even has a supermoto mode, for when you absolutely feel like backing it in while on holiday.
WHEELS AND TIRES
The Pirelli Angel GT’s on the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT offer eager steering, with a broad grip range and fantastic stability. These tubeless sports tires are fitted on alloy rims manufactured in a low-pressure die casting process. Not only do these featherweight wheels make the bike lighter overall, they also minimize the unsprung masses and moment of inertia, with a positive impact on the handling and ride dynamics.
STEERING DAMPER
With so much propulsive power, the front wheel could become very light, which could quickly lead to unpleasant kick-back on uneven roads or following a slight stimulus at the handlebar. The Super Duke GT prevents this safely with a reliable and sensitive WP steering damper.

2023 GASGAS MC-E 3
Introducing our newest dirt bike - the awesome MC-E 3! Designed to be a more budget-friendly way of getting into the offroad world, make no mistake, it’s assembled with the same passion and quality parts as all other bikes in the GASGAS line-up. Easy to ride and personalise thanks to six different power modes and an adjustable seat height, this lightweight, battery-powered dirt shredder instils confidence in all young riders as they quickly get to grips with learning the fundamentals of riding motocross. And it produces next to no noise, and certainly no carbon emissions, which means fun times without disturbing the neighbours!
PREMIUM QUALITY
The MC-E 3 is the deal! It’s a fully-fledged offroad bike designed for the next wave of fresh talent looking to get their riding career off to super-fun start, as well as those kids that just fancy whizzing around with their buddies. Built with a strong and durable frame, quality WP suspension, and a long list of high level components, the GASGAS MC-E 3 is the best bike to enter the world of offroad fun.
FRAME
Stable at speed and super easy to corner, our engineers designed the MC-E 3 frame to give all youngsters total control. Made from chromoly steel, it’s strong, lightweight, and finished with a cool and durable GASGAS red powder coating that really does look the business.
SAFETY
Mistakes happen while learning to ride, which is all part of the fun! This is why the MC-E 3 has a roll-over sensor that stops the motor if the bike hits the deck. There's also a lanyard attached to the rider's wrist and in the event of a fall, this stops the motor. A final layer of security is the dongle located under the seat. This little device overrides the Control Center and saves the selected ride mode, which prevents excitable youngsters from changing to a more powerful setting before they're ready for it.
Features may include:
WP FORKS
Taking care of the suspension duties up front is a set of 35mm WP XACT forks. Designed specifically for the MC-E 3, the USD forks deliver impressive performance which allows riders to develop their speed in complete confidence. With 144mm of travel, no jump or bump is too big for the MC-E 3.
WP SHOCK
We only use quality, high performance parts to build the MC-E 3, like the WP monoshock that is linked directly to the swingarm. Perfectly matched to the WP XACT forks, all riders will benefit from 133mm of travel as they get on the gas and attack the track.
CONTROL CENTER
Some call this a multifunctional instrument but we like to call it the Control Center! It's where you can toggle through and activate one of the six pre-installed ride modes based on rider ability, from pure beginners all the way through to those competing in Junior E-Motocross races. At a glance you'll also be able to see the remaining battery level, too.
BATTERY
The MC-E 3 is equipped with the best battery on the market. Made up from 60 modern lithium ion cells, which are safely housed inside a robust die-cast case, the battery fits neatly inside the frame and just above the motor. Storing 648Wh of energy provides two hours of riding time for a beginner or 30 minutes for riders that rip. The integrated Battery Management System (BMS) ensures the safety and longevity for the battery pack.
CHARGER
Making things easy for everyone is the 110-230 Volt worldwide charger. Quick and simple to plug in and restore power, the MC-E 3 can be fully recharged in 60 minutes or for those who can’t wait to ride, an 80% charge can be achieved in just 30 minutes.

2023 GASGAS MC 65
Fresh spice
Clutch in, select the gear, revs up, slowly release the clutch… that magical moment when a young motocrosser takes control of a full-on race machine for the first time. Our MC 65 is the perfect choice for any youngster to dive deeper into the world of dirt bike fun. With a series of updates on the 2023 models, the MC 65 has never been better. Featuring an updated hydraulic clutch, 6-speed transmission, highly competitive 65cc 2-stroke engine, stronger chain, super grippy and durable tires, and WP Suspension, it’s a true performance offroad bike.
Features may include:
STYLE
BODYWORK
Looks cool doesn't it! Embracing the same stylish GASGAS characteristics that all our bikes possess, the MC 65 features vibrant red bodywork that's designed to offer complete freedom of movement on the bike. It's super easy to move forward when cornering or move backwards when getting on the gas, attacking jumps, or braking into corners. Style and function in one!
GRAPHICS
Our youthful and energetic DNA is something we like to celebrate with the graphics on all of our motocross bikes, not least the MC 65. Wrapping our mini-racer in red bodywork, the graphics are applied using in-mold technology to ensure durability and long-lasting quality.
HANDLING
FRAME
With its easily detachable lightweight subframe and high-strength chromium molybdenum steel chassis, the MC 65 has a frame that delivers stability and easy handling. Allowing riders to shoot in and out of turns and feel confident attacking rough, whooped out straights, the precise mix of flex and rigidity ensures confidence inspiring handling.
WP FORKS
The 35mm WP XACT forks allow riders to push harder, jump further and continue building their confidence and skills. Super lightweight, with 215mm of travel they allow riders to push harder and race faster. Rider weight, set-up preferences as well as track conditions can all be taken into consideration when fine-tuning the forks, which can be done quickly and easily by adjusting the air unit on the left fork leg.
MOTOR
Giving junior racers the opportunity to dive deeper into the world of dirt bike fun, the MC 65 has a hydraulic clutch and a 6-speed gearbox, allowing riders to master a bike that's just like dad's. A highly competitive 65cc 2-stroke motor is built to perform, and last. Made with durable materials and featuring a pressure-controlled exhaust valve the MC 65 delivers big performance.
CYLINDER
The Pressure-Controlled Exhaust Valve (PCEV) system plays a huge role in ensuring our lightweight and durable cylinder delivers the performances needed to get young racers out of the gate and into the first corner ahead of the rest. In the highly competitive 65cc class the MC 65 is ready to muscle its way to the front.
PARTS
BRAKES
With the power to get riders stopped when they dive up the inside to make a pass, the MC 65 retains its proven 198mm front disc while we've added a new, bigger 180mm wave disc at the rear. Together with the new Formula hydraulic brake calipers, they ensure serious stopping capabilities.
HYDRAULIC CLUTCH
This year we've updated the clutch lever and control. As we know, little hands need a light clutch, which is why the MC 65 has a lightweight hydraulic system that guarantees a super smooth action and near maintenance free operation. With play constantly adjusted, no matter what the conditions or the weather, the biting point remains the same so riders can enjoy racing bar-to-bar.

2023 Suzuki DR-Z400SM
Suzuki's 2023 SuperMoto DR-Z400SM is based on the proven DR-Z400S. So it combines Supermotard style and features in a narrow, lightweight, street-legal package. This bike brings off-road soul and fun to paved roads. It’s not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.
Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor. The inverted fork contributes to less unsprung weight and improved overall handling, while the large brake and wider rims with high-grip tires offer an exhilarating sportbike experience.
Features may include:

Low-maintenance, long-life, sealed O-ring type drive chain produces minimal sounds when riding.
Chassis
Wide, blue- or black-anodized RK Excel aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes are fitted with sporty radial tires: 120/70-R17 front and 140/70-R17 rear.
Strong braking performance is supplied by a front disc brake with a large 300mm floating-type rotor and dual-piston caliper, plus a 240mm rear disc brake with a single-piston caliper.

Electrical
Compact, digital instrument cluster includes speedometer, odometer, twin-trip meters with addition/subtraction capability, clock, and stopwatch functions.
On-road legal lighting includes bright 60/55-watt halogen headlight, compact tail/stoplight, lightweight, rubber-mounted turn signals, and horn.

2023 Honda® NC750X DCT
NEVER COMPROMISE
It’s the dilemma we all face as motorcyclists—or at least those of us who haven’t won the lottery. If we can only have one bike, which one comes the closest to being able to do it all, and do it well? Fortunately, there’s an easy answer, and a great bike: the Honda NC750X DCT. The parallel-twin engine is versatile and has plenty of power. The seating position is comfortable no matter where you ride or for how long. The automatic DCT transmission lets you shift when you want to, or lets the bike shift for you. A lockable, weather-resistant, integrated storage compartment makes it practical, and adventure-inspired suspension lets you explore the dirt roads if you’d like. And of course there’s a wide selection of accessories so you can fine-tune it to your own preference. Do it all? Why not—with a Honda NC750X.
Features may include:
CONVENIENCE
INTEGRATED STORAGE COMPARTMENT
The 2023 NC750X offers a large 23-liter utility compartment that’s big enough to hold most dual-sport full-face helmets with a visor, and then some. Secure and convenient, you'll use it every time you ride.
TECHNOLOGY
Honda SELECTABLE TORQUE CONTROL (HSTC)
With Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) you can choose a level which allows some rear-wheel spin—on gravel or dirt for instance—or pick a second level which reduces wheel spin, particularly on slippery roads. It’s a great feature that helps make the NC750X even more versatile.
PERFORMANCE
PARALLEL-TWIN ENGINE
The NC750X's engine is a big step forward in modern powerplant design. The two-cylinder format produces tons of low- and mid-range torque, and the 270-degree-phase crank and uniaxial primary balancer make it smooth, too.
COMFORT
LOW-PROFILE WINDSCREEN
The NC750X offers just the right amount of bodywork—enough to offer good wind protection, but not so much that the bike feels heavy or wide.

2018 BMW K1600B Low Miles and Beautiful!,https://portland.craigslist.org/yam/mcy/d/springfield-2018-bmw-k1600b-low-miles/7580849056.html,7580849056.0,"02/02/2023, 15:14:10","$18,900","Hello, If you are interested in this bike then you probably already know something about it but if not read the reviews. Everybody who rides bikes should own a six cylinder BMW at one point. It has 165 hp and 129 ft. Pounds of torque with the Remus exhaust and is turbine smooth. I’ve owned over 50 Street motorcycles and this one is probably the best. I’m only selling it because I like to try new things but I will definitely own another one. You may be able to find another for little less money but if you buy one and then add the extras that makes this a better bike it adds up. It has under 6400 miles. It has a GPS and every factory option from BMW including the option 719 forged wheels. They probably don’t add anything to the performance of the bike but they sure look cool. I haven’t checked with Bmw but my dealer said only one in 20 B models are ordered with them because of their expense. If you want to put them on a bike after purchase they are over $4500. The Remus exhaust was $2600. Expensive but it sounds so awesome once you hear it it’s another thing you’ll really want. Not too loud at cruising speeds but just a much more aggressive tone. IMO the B model come with one of the worst stock seats of any bike I’ve owned especially such an expensive one. The Sargent seat I added was over $900 but makes the bike rideable all day. And it’s getting better every mile. I’ve owned several Gustafsson windscreens and they are my favorite. The one they offer wasn’t as wide as I wanted so I sent them a template to custom make me one. It turned out great. With the BMWs electric windshield you can raise and lower it to the perfect position for your body and weather. I recently installed some Metzeler Road-Tec 01 tires in the HWM (heavy weight motorcycle) version. Another big improvement. It’s had a recent synthetic oil change and is cross country ready. I have saddle bag luggage. I have the pricey factory cover that’s never been out of the box. I also have the BMW GS 911 diagnostic tool which I’ve never used. All this adds up to a bike you don’t have to add anything to or maintain for a long time. If you buy a bike that needs tires maintenance etc. plan on thousands out of pocket. I have the stock exhaust, windscreen and seat. The bike is in awesome condition. No tipovers. Title is in my hand. I’m in Springfield. Come buy it and ride it home! I may be interested in trading for a 2020 or newer low mileage Indian. Please no Craigslist Scams. I’ve heard them all. And no test rides without money in my hand. Bike is too expensive. Thanks for looking!",gas,6371.0,manual,,excellent,clean,,black,yes,sport touring,,,,,

Bought brand new for daughter during July 2022, but she likes horses more so this bike barely was ridden. It is basically brand new without even a scratch, and includes spares which I purchased but never needed. It was mostly ridden a few times in the yard.

This bike is built with amazing quality for a kid’s bike, like a miniature KTM. It is narrow which allows kids to touch the ground easily and not catch footpegs in ruts. The hydraulic brakes have kid size master cylinders and levers, it has black aluminum rims with Michelin Starcross tires (14” front and 12” rear), real footpegs and the list goes on and on. The bike with battery ready to ride only weighs 77 lbs! The light weight is the main reason I chose this bike for my daughter over a CRF-50, TTR-110 or similar gas bike. The light weight with top of the line tires and geometry make it handle and corner very well. It’s a good looking little bike.

Seat Height: 25.2”
Weight: 77 Lbs.
The seat height is taller than a standard 50, and a little lower than a 110, it weights about half as much and will smoke a 50 in a drag race and beat all the trail bikes at corner speed. Comparing it to a PW-80 it climbs hills much better.

The power levels and top speed are programmable via the app, and it also has a half-speed switch located behind the engine cover to slow your kid down if need be.

Spare Parts included which I purchased and never needed:
1. Extra quik change battery $485
2. Extra charger $129
3. Spare front brake lever $12
4. Spare rear brake lever $12
5. Spare electronic throttle assembly $27
6. Spare front tube $19
7. Spare rear tube $15
8. Spare grips L+R $7

Spare battery, charger, and parts value $706
MSRP for 2022 Motocross Two $3,250
Total MSRP bike and parts $3,956

Other than an occasional chain lube, there really isn’t much maintenance required.

2020 KTM 85 SX 19/16
STEP INTO THE BIG LEAGUES
With the pro ranks within reach, the KTM 85 SX offers a real taste of the big league of motocross. Following in the footsteps of champions, every inch of this motorcycle mimics the proven design of the big bike range. A lightweight, high-quality frame houses its compact rocket ship of an engine, which delivers unrivaled performance and rideability. This mini warrior is the ultimate race weapon and is ready to go out and conquer all in the fight for the top step of the podium.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
KTM 2-strokes have been tearing up MX tracks for decades and are undoubtedly the fastest on the track today. Thanks to years of ongoing development, these engines are the benchmark in performance and technology, with the perfect combination of power, weight and control. Through melodic high-RPM screams, KTM 2-strokes continue to deliver thrilling high-performance harmonics.
CHASSIS
For the 85 cc, KTM has successfully developed a chassis that not only handles the hard-charging brutality of a 15-year-old, but also effectively accommodates a lightweight newcomer to the class. This is achieved through its lightweight, high-tech steel frame. Its optimized flex characteristics provide a great feeling for the rider and help to soak up those big hits, while also delivering excellent agility and high-speed stability. Every element is designed to work in perfect harmony and contributes to an intuitive ride like no other.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
85 cc riders come in all shapes and sizes, which requires intelligent motorcycle design to cater for these dynamics. For optimal high-performance ergonomics, KTM used the proven design of the big bike range on the KTM 85 SX. The goal was to provide a neutral riding position that, together with perfectly shaped bodywork, offers the best rider comfort and maneuverability. A rider's main interaction with the motorcycle comes through the seat, footpegs and handlebars, which is why KTM has used the best quality parts in these areas. The placement of these crucial contact points is also vitally important for balance and control and, through various handlebar position options, can be adjusted to suit a rider's preference. This ensures the optimal riding position for race-winning performance.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
The bodywork on the 2020 KTM 85 SX is carried over from its predecessor and was designed to have the same touch points and overall feeling as the full size SX range. This similarity in bodywork is great preparation for an 85 cc rider's imminent move to the bigger bikes of pro-level motocross, making the transition as seamless as possible. KTM factory riders, KTM R&D and Kiska Design all contributed to achieving the goal of complete harmony between rider and bike. These contact points allow maximum freedom of movement and improved agility. The front and rear fenders have an I-beam structure, which are prime examples of the intelligent design that produces maximum stability with the lowest possible weight.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Absolute performance purity is the name of the game when it comes to the KTM 85 SX. Undiluted 2-stroke simplicity with an hour meter to keep a check on how long you've been shredding and an optional rev counter to assist with perfect setup.

The Bad:
Needs a new front tire soon. Rear is about half-way worn.
Left muffler was damaged and repaired by previous owner. This has affected the exhaust flow resistance and it's not the same as stock. Runs a little rich on the rear cylinder because of this.

My mechanic re-adjusted the carbs but recommended going with a Rottweiler 2 into 1 flange, he said it will also give the bike more low-end power and fix the air/fuel ratio. The current side-effects are some mild back-firing when rolling off the gas at speed. Bike runs but it will run better with the 2 into 1 exhaust, plus that's how they do it in Dakar right?

Rottweiler also makes a backup reserve fuel tank that bolts into its place which is pretty rad.

Backstory:
I once was telling a friend to keep an eye out for a KTM 690 Enduro R, since he lived in Gold Country (near Tahoe) and there is a high dirt bike per capita % there..

He said ""Why the hell would you want one of those?!""

""Because it's the most bad-ass enduro ever made!"" I replied.

To which he smugly replied ""No it ain't, 950 Super Enduro R is..""

""Where the hell you gonna find one of those, they're unobtainable? Only 3,000 units were ever made and they sell for more than original retail!""

""You should buy mine, I just bought a 6-Days and haven't been doing it justice lately. It needs someone who will enjoy it more than I have time for.""

Hoping to find a buyer who will love this thing as much as I do. Hard to let it go but I'm finding myself spending way more time on the Multistrada these days riding than on the dirt.

I originally purchased this bike when my driveway was a steep switch-backed 3 mile-long fire road and I enjoyed commuting to and from work, rousing neighbors with the deep roar of the 100HP+ LC8 TORQUE MONSTER Engine, roosting plumes of dirt that could be seen for miles and drifting the back end around the sweepers all the way up the hill home.

This thing can do it all, tour to your trailhead on the highway, then blast through wilderness leaving your friends in the dust and get you home comfortably when it's all over.",gas,15912.0,manual,,good,clean,950.0,orange,yes,dual,yes,,,,

Comments for this 2008 Yamaha YZ450F White Red:
2008 Yamaha YZ450F
Key Features May Include
The bike that started the four-stroke revolution benefits from chassis and engine refinements that ensure the five-titanium-valved YZ450F remains at the head of the open-class pack.
Subtle modifications to the aluminum frame and suspension mean light, precise, confident handling at any speed.
New head and exhaust design delivers stronger low- to midrange power without sacrificing top end power.
Ready to race straight out of the crate with a ProTaper aluminum handlebar in adjustable clamps, titanium shock spring, gripper seat, Excel rims, etc.
Five-speed gearbox provides maximum flexibility and the right gear for a wide range of riding environments.
Features & Benefits
New For 2008
Micron-level adjustment of piston external diameter minimizes piston- to-cylinder clearance for reduced vibration and mechanical noise.
Adjustment of gear backlash between clutch primary gears and balancer gears achieves further mechanical noise reduction.
A new, larger-diameter titanium exhaust header with revised taper characteristics enhances exhaust efficiency.
First punched cone muffler ever on a production bike allows 35 percent length reduction and 270-gram weight reduction while meeting AMA noise regulations.
Matte black crankcase covers: light, strong and cool-looking.
Steering head pipe and steering stem are 5mm shorter; lower forged triple steering clamp is lighter for enhanced handling feel. Swingarm pivot stiffness is revised to complement front-end changes and further lighten and improve steering/handling.
Changes to the shape of the outer fork tubes and revised internals result in improved damping and a smoother ride.
Optimized linkage ratio provides a smoother ride and enhanced rear wheel traction.
New, YZ250F-style, front-brake caliper (-220 grams) and a lighter disc remove unsprung weight and provide excellent stopping power. A new axle and collar remove additional weight.
A 120/80-19 rear Dunlop D756 knobby replaces the 110/90-19 for even more traction. A D742FA replaces the D739FAL front tire.
Wider footpegs provide excellent boot traction and rider comfort.
Engine
449cc five-valve DOHC liquid-cooled engine is super-powerful yet tractable.
39mm Keihin FCR flat-slide carburetor with throttle position sensor (TPS) and leak jet delivers precise fuel/air mixture and instant throttle response.
Lightweight titanium valves and load-reduced springs minimize reciprocating mass for fast-revving, hard-hitting power delivery across the rev range.
Primary kickstarting with automatic decompression and convenient, handlebar-mounted hot start lever ensures easy restarts.
Large-capacity radiator is reinforced for greater strength.
Chassis/Suspension
Extensively tested aluminum frame uses a mix of alloy castings, forgings and extrusions to produce a tuned-flex frame that makes the YZ the finest-handling motocross bike ever.
Speed-Sensitive System 48mm Kayaba fork places transfer control valves (TCV) above the fork springs, so that damping force is controlled by piston speed: Eliminating mid-stroke damping force changes provides a smoother, more precise ride.
Titanium-sprung, four-way adjustable rear shock with Kashima-coated internals reduces friction for fantastic compliance and great handling.
Removable aluminum rear subframe constructed of square-section tubing for light weight and easy maintenance.
Lightweight front-wheel hub for reduced unsprung weight and increased durability.
Lightweight front- and rear-brake calipers with aluminum pistons and anti-bubble front master cylinder; wave-style rotors reduce unsprung weight and deliver strong stopping power.

The 689cc fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, DOHC inline twin gives this bike more power and improved fuel economy while the counterbalanced two-cylinder design provides smooth, long-legged power and exceptional handing. A lightweight, high-strength tubular steel frame provides a tuned rigidity balance for nimble, responsive handling with the strength and durability needed to tackle the harshest terrain with confidence. The chassis utilizes a short 62.6-inch wheelbase for agility and boasts 9.5 inches of ground clearance to tackle whatever the trail throws at you. The narrow body and fuel tank also enable the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence whether you're riding on dirt or asphalt. The adventure-ready suspension utilizes a long-travel 43mm inverted fork with 8.3 inches of travel. The beefy inverted layout is highly resistant to flex to maintain precise steering and suspension action, and the fork is fully adjustable to match changing road and trail conditions. The linkage-type rear shock is similarly outfitted for adventure, with 7.9 inches of travel, and a remote preload adjuster to easily fine tune for changing loads or riding conditions.

I am the 2nd owner. The person I bought it from purchased it brand new and proceeded to transform the bike into an Ultra—batwing fairing, tour pack (lockable and quick release), lockable hard bags and lower fairings—all color matched Harley parts in vivid black. 96 ci motor.

V&H Bigshot exhaust, tuner, Avon grips, highway pegs, electronic cruise, passenger floorboards, sundowner seat, backrest, adjustable suspension, chrome fork covers, etc.

Michelin Commander II tires—the back tire is brand new, front tire has another season or more (depending on your riding). 45.5K miles.
I have all maintenance records, a shop manual, and 2 key fobs.

If you’re thinking about getting into touring & want to get into a quality bike for about a third of the cost of something new—come take a look. The body is in very good condition. The motor is excellent. $7700 OBO. Clean title in hand. Cash preferred. Sorry no trades.

2022 Ducati SuperSport 950 S White Silk
Your way to sport.
The Ducati sports bike made for the road changes its name and becomes SuperSport 950, renewing its aesthetics, electronic equipment and high level of features.
The design of the SuperSport 950 evolves thanks to the new fairings designed by Ducati Style Centre which give the bike more sportiness, dynamism, and fluidity in its shape with a strong and decisive resemblance to the Panigale V4.
Watch the 3rd episode of the Ducati World Première
Discover everything about the new SuperSport 950 presented by Alessandro Valia, Ducati Official Tester, and Julien Clement, Ducati Senior Designer Style Centre.
Design
The strengths of the Ducati sports bike intended for the road have always been their dynamic style, visual compactness, elegant lines and proportions typical of Panigale sports bikes.
The new SuperSport 950, thanks to new fairings, becomes more sporty and shapely with a strong reference to the Panigale V4 with a new full-LED headlight and side air vents.

Features may include:
LATERAL VIEW
New fairings
The side view of the SuperSport 950 is marked by air vents reminiscent of the double extractor of the Panigale V4 models. The lower fairing now extends to the side silencer, hiding the mechanical components and visually recalling the track bikes.
FRONTAL VIEW
New full-LED headlamp
The front view is dominated by the new full-LED headlamp with Daytime Running Light (DRL), which clearly recalls the bright and sharp signature of the Panigale V4
THE WINDSHIELD
New windshield
The windshield of the SuperSport 950 is low to create a streamlined and dynamic line, centrally connected to the tank bringing the body color into the cockpit, with a modern design that houses the new full-TFT color dashboard. Aerodynamic protection is guaranteed by a sporty cut Plexiglas that is height adjustable in two positions.

Clear body language – the unmistakable XR.
The motivation of the F 900 XR can be seen at the very first glance. The striking LED light guides of the newly developed headlight emphasize the commanding nature of the F 900 XR – a feeling that you know best. The fairing builds further upon this dynamic excitement. Precise edges define its aggressive design. The slim and visually short tail invokes the athletic energy of this long-distance performer.

Well, if this insatiable desire for every straightaway, this drive to always go further, meet the right partners: The high-torque two cylinder in-line engine of the F 900 XR delivers between 4,500 and 8,500 rpm for 68 lb-ft. The optional Dynamic ESA delivers optimal suspension comfort and very stable handling. Those who press forward like this leave the others behind.
Systematic safety features.
Numerous other innovations ensure a pleasant and relaxed ride. The Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Engine Braking Control (EBC) deliver more control for emergency braking and for abrupt releases of the accelerator as well as sudden downshifts.
Visionary – literally.
The F 900 XR is setting standards when it comes to illumination. It has an adaptive cornering light – available for the first time in the mid-range segment. Placed in the newly developed striking LED headlamps, it provides perfect illumination for corners at a 7° angle: an obvious plus when riding at night or with poor lighting conditions.

2021 Ducati Diavel 1260 S Ducati Red
Rob the scene
Born To Be The Hero
Powerful. Muscular. But also agile and effective between the curves for maximum riding enjoyment. The Diavel 1260 combines the performance of a maxi-naked with the ergonomics of a muscle cruiser. Its design reinterprets the Diavel style with a contemporary look and integrates perfectly the 162 HP Testastretta DVT 1262 engine, beating heart of this new Diavel 1260.
The standard version is available in total black: the Dark Stealth coloring includes matt black for the superstructures, which is combined with rims, frame and mechanical parts also in black with different finishes.
The S version, on the other hand, is available in Ducati red with white graphics, alternating with black parts, giving the Diavel 1260 a new sportiness, without sacrificing the style that distinguishes this model.
Features may include:
DESIGN
A contemporary character
Muscular lines and an imposing front bring out the strong and restless personality of the new Diavel, featuring a long, slender rear with a 240 mm rear wheel. The color range of the Diavel 1260 has been updated: the standard version is now available in total black, while the S version is available in Ducati red with white graphics. A new sporty Diavel 1260 S, without sacrificing the style that distinguishes it.
ENGINE
The engine is the king
The new Diavel is built around the Testastretta DVT 1262 engine, a beacon of power, beauty, and sophistication. Its 157 hp translate to unbelievable acceleration and pick-up, while the flat and consistent torque curve low rpm allows steady and easy to handle delivery. The Ride by Wire (RbW) control matched with three Riding Modes and three Power Modes allows personalized engine responsiveness. A true beauty, as far as mechanics and design go, and a real game-changer on the road.
ERGONOMICS
Riding pleasure at its best
Sportiness and comfort meet in the new Diavel. The trellis frame ensures lightness and torsional rigidity, while the adjustable fork provides comfort and stability. The care devoted to ergonomics is complemented by the perfect combination of a higher handlebar, a lower seat and central footpegs, with a comfortable and versatile riding position. The S version is fitted with Öhlins suspensions, for a guaranteed fun and exciting riding experience.
DETAILS
Cheeky elegance
The new Diavel is an ode to elegance and sophisticated details: carbon fiber components and a finely stitched premium quality seat complement the Diavel’s outstanding style. No compromises were made on its aggressive character, as Marchesini forged rims and the Thrilling Black & Dark Stealth liveries testify. The Daytime Running Light (DRL) headlight, available on the S version, is an unmistakable hallmark of the new Diavel.

2018 Husqvarna Vitpilen 701 Reduced Price! SKU: PJM725432,https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/mcd/d/portland-2018-husqvarna-vitpilen-701/7579621323.html,7579621323.0,"02/02/2023, 15:16:34","$7,999","Description:

MotoCorsa Pre-Owned Manager's Special: Was $8999, NOW $7999! If Vitpilen means ""white arrow"" in Swedish, why is this silver version not a Silverpilen? Good question. Part 1 of the answer is Husqvarna did in fact have a Silverpilen model as far back as 1960--and it was red. Part 2 is the designers probably just wanted to mix things up a bit. The Vitpilen is the cafe racer version of the Svartpilen (""black arrow"") scrambler, thus it features lower clip-on handlebars and street-biased tires. This 2018 701 version has just 8K miles on it, and has been thoughtfully upgraded with a smoked windscreen and handguards to increase its highway worthiness. * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2021 Ducati Monster + Ducati Red
Just Fun
All the essence of Ducati in a modern and contemporary motorcycle. Here is the new Monster in the most compact, essential and lightest possible form.
A project that reappropriates the original 1993 concepts with a superbike derived frame, in aluminium, which helps to reduce the weight to just 366 lb dry, - 39.6 lb less than the Monster 821.
Narrow sides and a design characterized by simple, clean lines make the bike compact and essential: an engine, a seat, the tank, the handlebars.
Everything you need to have fun, nothing more.
Features may include:
DESIGN
A new Monster Design
The new Monster draws its DNA from the model dated back 1993, namely reflects what is needed to get supreme fun when riding a bike. In other words, an engine, a seat, a tank, a handlebar. Furthermore, it integrates all the unmistakable elements that characterize the iconic model: the bison-back-shaped tank, the round headlight, the clean tail, not to mention greater emphasis given to the engine.
VEHICLE
Front Frame
The new Monster brings the engine back to center-stage. Linked to a front frame derived from the the Panigale V4, the new engine is made of aluminium and is 10 lbs (4.5 kg) lighter than the 821 model.
Sleek tail
The sleek tail, attached directly to the engine, also participates in the overall lightness. A single element made of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) which acts as a load-bearing tail and as a support for all the electrical and electronic parts. The battery has also been revamped in terms of size (now smaller) and lightness. In general, each component has been designed to be as light as possible.
Seat height
The rider is now even more at ease and relaxed thanks to a particular design of the seat, characterized not only by an extremely reduced shape of the seat-to-foot area but also by an exclusive foam. This latter element maximizes comfort and gives the real feedback of “what’s happening” under the wheels. The riding position has been refreshed to further enhance ergonomics, control and comfort.
Hydraulic clutch
The clutch equipping the new Monster is wet anti-patter type and thanks to its particular self-servo system can guarantee a smooth feedback. Thanks to the new hydraulic control results extremely “light” to pull (-20% effort) and perfect in modulating the attack to suit riders of all levels and spirit.
ENGINE
Everything you need to have fun
The new Monster is powered by the 937 cc twin-cylinder Desmodromic Testastretta 11° engine. In this latest version its weight has been reduced (-5.3 lb), now achieving further performance as well as usability levels. Designed to be a stressed chassis element, the twin-cylinder represents a crucial element capable of ensuring the motorcycle overall lightness.

2018 Ducati Panigale V4
A New Opera
It is called Panigale V4 and it marks a new and important chapter in Ducati's history, a ""symphony"" of performance and emotions that's 100% Italian. Panigale V4 is the first mass-produced Ducati motorcycle to be equipped with a 4-cylinder engine, closely derived from the Desmosedici of the MotoGP.
V4 revolution
The Panigale V4 replaces the iconic 1299 at the top of the Ducati supersport range, doing so by enhancing performance and ridability so that riders of all skill levels can enjoy boundless fun and excitement. The Panigale V4 has been developed in close collaboration with Ducati Corse, drawing directly on know-how and technology from the racing world to provide a road bike that is the closest thing possible to its MotoGP counterpart.
Features may include:
CONCEPT
A new paradigm
The new Panigale V4 is the essence of sport motorcycling in its most exhilarating and pure form: redefined design, new engine, state-of-the-art chassis and innovative electronics. A concentrated blend of Ducati technology, style and performance
DESIGN
The character has taken shape
Elegant, muscular, technological. This is the essence of the style of the new Panigale V4. The Ducati Style Centre gave shape to the character of the bike and its performance following what for Ducati are the canons of Italian sports elegance: large and soft surfaces interrupted by few bold marks. Component integration, the idea of power and functionality have become dominant elements of the style and of the whole project.
ENGINE
V4 di 90°: the racing soul
The new Desmosedici Stradale engine has been designed based on the experience gained in MotoGP. The typical approach used in competitions is found in the extraordinary power and torque values: the 90° V4 with a displacement of 1,103 cm³, the counter-rotating crankshaft and the 4 valves per cylinder with desmodromic distribution that reaches 214 hp (157.5 kW ) of maximum power at 13,000 rpm and 122 Nm (12.44 kgm) of maximum torque at 10,000 rpm.
TECHNOLOGY
Last generation electronics
The performance of the Desmosedici Stradale must always be easily manageable to achieve maximum racing results, optimising the energies and concentration of the rider. The new Panigale V4's control electronics use the six-axis inertial platform data (6D IMU) that make it possible to capture and record extensive amounts of information.
SAFETY
The new Panigale V4 sets new absolute performance benchmarks and raises vehicle safety and dynamics control standards with a state-of-the-art electronics package that maximises the potential offered by Bosch's six-axis inertial platform. Other original controls have also been introduced, like controlled slides during braking, ABS Cornering that acts only on the front brake with a setup that was designed specifically for track riding, and Quickshift Up & Down with a strategy that takes into account the lean angle.

The point of a custom motorcycle today is to have something truly unique. Something no one else has, and something you can just look at and get enjoyment from. On the other side of that is, it would be nice to also have something you can actually use, ride in comfort, and of course...Reliability!
Take a good look at this custom built bike by Ashcroft Motorcycles. This bike is well thought out, and customized in such a way that you can actually ride it anywhere. The engine fires right up and runs great, like an Evo should. The 5 speed transmission shifts smoothly with it's new clutch assembly, and all components on the bike work as they should.
The exhaust system gives a nod to the Choppers of the 1960's, and assists the big V-Twin in making it's signature rumble. If you're contemplating a motorcycle that will look spectacular in your living room, look tough in your garage or shop, and provide a fun reliable smooth Softail ride, this bike would make a great choice!

2022 KTM 890 Duke GP
THE SCALPEL
The KTM 890 DUKE GP is unparalleled in the middle-weight arena. Boasting an all-new and totally unique GP-derived CTG, a lightweight chassis providing unmatched agility in the twisties, and heavy-hitting power delivery for the straightaways, the KTM 890 DUKE GP hits as hard as you'd expect - with the visual impact to match.
Features may include:ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The LC8c engine shares a great deal of its ferocity with the ultra-sharp KTM 890 DUKE R. Boasting a hard-hitting 889 cc, liquid-cooled, 8 valve powerplant, it is the most compact twin in class, punching way above its weight in terms of output.
Cylinder heads
The 8 valve DOHC cylinder head contains twin chain-driven camshafts and one sparkplug per cylinder. Additionally, the camshafts in the KTM 890 DUKE GP are assembled, which makes them even lighter than forged camshafts. DLC coated finger followers, steel valves and a hydraulic chain tensioner complete the cylinder head assembly.
Balancer shafts
No one enjoys unpleasant vibes. That is why the KTM 890 DUKE GP employs the use of balancer shafts placed in front of the crankshaft and in the cylinder head to ensure the smoothest power delivery and minimal vibration.CHASSIS
Frame
The incredible handling characteristics of the KTM 890 DUKE GP are founded on the dynamic, loadbearing design of the tubular chassis. Engineers had one goal in mind, and that was to keep the chassis as rigid and compact as possible for sharper turn-in and greater lean angles, allowing it to slice through the turns with extreme responsiveness.
Subframe
The subframe is cast aluminum and houses the airbox. No plastic covers, no additional brackets - everything is cast into two connected pieces to reduce complexity and weight. The triangular shapes in the subframe allow for a stronger, stiffer construction.
Swingarm
The die-cast, open-lattice swingarm is meticulously manufactured and has been optimized for stiffness and stability while still offering excellent flex characteristics. By using a direct link for the rear shock, complexity and parts are reduced.ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
A tapered aluminum, 760 mm wide handlebar puts you in full control. It's adjustable, with 4 positions on the triple clamp and can be rotated in three further positions for that perfect riding position.
Seats
With an easy-to-reach of seat height of 820 mm, all riders can enjoy the KTM 890 DUKE GP at full tilt. A grippy seat cover allows riders to move around the bike easily but has enough grip to keep them planted at extreme lean angles. KTM 890 DUKE GP also features a unique hard pillion seat cover, giving a leaner, more aggressive look, but also setting it apart as a proper single-seater street racer.BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
TFT dashboard
Like all pilots, DUKE riders need easy access to information. In that regard, the KTM 890 DUKE GP features an intuitive multicolor, light variable TFT dashboard. Best of all, as the revs rise, the display bars change color to indicate when to shift, either spurring you on or warning you that the engine is too still cold for flat-out backroad attacks.

The facts:
I'm the second owner of this lovely red KLR (I purchased from a family friend). She's been my daily rider, year 'round, since purchase.
-36,624 miles
-Clean title in hand
-Oxford heated grips
-Upgraded skid plate
-SW Motech crash bars (don't worry, I already tested them for you and they are wonderful!)
-Luggage rack
-Currently starts & runs
-Garaged, well maintained

YOU can be the one to give her the doohickey she's always wanted! She's no beauty queen, but she works hard and has plenty more adventures in her future!

The issues:
Never leaked oil, however, somehow lost oil during a long ride and ended up unknowingly riding with no oil for a bit. Mechanic tells me it needs a new connecting rod, crank shaft, and likely could use some top end work due to valve strain.

An easy project for someone with the know-how and patience.
Unfortunately, I do not have the time or money to help this KLR return to glory. She's got a lot of life left in her, help her live it!

If you're reading this ad, you already know the KLR650 is an awesome adventure bike. This bike is easy to ride and reliable. You could be out exploring the back roads of the PNW by spring!

2021 Royal Enfield Interceptor 650,https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/mcy/d/portland-2021-royal-enfield-interceptor/7579239547.html,7579239547.0,"02/02/2023, 15:17:31","$6,950","Like New condition with many upgrades. This bike is a break-trough modern classic that is enjoying a tremendous sales success all over the world. It has an old-school, retro aesthetic, yet it houses a decent amount of modern technology, such as a six-speed, easy to shift transmission fuel injection and ABS, which has led to being known as a lite version of Harley-Davidson. This particular unit has been transformed into a comfortable touring motorcycle while still providing an easy and relaxing ride in city traffic.

The Interceptor 650 by Royal Enfield is a recent design that has enjoyed phenomenal success in the global market, fast becoming a best seller in the 650cc twin category - owing to its smooth power, thrilling and easy ride, paired with a great price tag which makes it accessible to a wide range of customers. Running on a smooth parallel twin-motor, excellent transmission and impressing riders with remarkable handling, the Interceptor 650 is a great bike with plenty to love.

Royal Enfield achieved a low price point by focusing on the basics: the smooth engine with a flat-curve fuel delivery and an outstanding chassis that makes this bike handle like a dream. However some budget solutions were incorporated (such as a somewhat choppy suspension) and the bikes are plagued with the overly lean fuel mixture mandated by the Euro 4 (up to 2021) and Euro 5 standards (2022 and newer), which sometimes resulted in stalling at low RPM. All these issues have been addressed on this particular motorcycle.

The upgrades:

I. Ride quality, comfort and fueling improvements:
- Upgraded front and rear suspension: TEC USA progressive springs plus racing quality fork oil to improve and even out rebounds in all temperatures.
- Front spring preload adjusters. The factory springs do not come with adjustable preload.
- Two into one single-pipe exhaust system (shaves about 26 pounds and breathes better, and adds torque in mid-range. These pipes are street legal and make a wonderful sound. Not obnoxious, but substantial.
- High flow, washable and reusable air filter, and enlarged air intake channel to match the better breathing pipes.
- Fuel plug to slightly enrich the mixture in open loop mode (idling, low RPM and changes in throttle position and/or load). This has eliminated the common stalling issue. It also allows the engine to run significantly cooler. Note: this solution will not work with the 2022 and newer models as they are Euro 5.
- Upgraded BOSCH relays (the RE originals can also cause stalling and fuel delivery issues).
- Touring seat (the original seat also comes with it).
- Side luggage racks.
- left and right side luggage. Plastic-backed genuine leather - will maintain their shape.
- Leather tank cover with two two side pockets for added storage space and wrap-around protection.
- Passenger foot peg relocation kit (not yet installed, comes with the bike).
- Quick-detach, adjustable angle touring windshield. A shorter fly screen also comes with it for summer-time use in the city.
- Bar risers that allow for a more comfortable straight back posture while riding.
- Upgraded, adjustable front brake and clutch levers.
- Grip Buddies.

II. Convenience and safety:
- Metal alloy radiator cover.
- Bar-mounted waterproof clock.
- Bar-mounted Tire Pressure Monitoring System.
- Rubber tank-mounted knee pads.
- Center stand and side-stand.
- Lockable fuel tank cap.
- Lockable seat and side cover.
- ABS brakes.
- Tires and brakes in excellent condition.

The bike has been carefully broken in, in accordance with the instructions. The 300 mile service has been performed including the motor oil change and valve clearance adjustment. This is a design that owners with basic mechanical skills can easily work on, performing most required maintenance. Balance of three-year factory warranty. Good for both beginner riders or the more experienced ones that got tired on touring on heavy or jerky, hard-to control motorcycles.

I purchased two CB175’s for restoration projects. The first bike (the Blue) is complete. I started the restoration on the second bike, but got pulled away by another project. This sale is for the second CB175 and is not shown in the pictures.

The Frame, Swingarm, Triple Clamp, Headlight Ears, Headlight Bucket, Seat Pan and Taillight Assembly were sandblasted and primed. The parts and wheels were reassembled into a rolling chassis.

The Seat was disassembled down to the pan. The foam was inspected, repaired and the seat cover replaced. It looks flawless.

Original Gas Tank in included. Leak free but it would appreciate a good cleaning/de-rusting.

The exterior of the engine was degreased. The engine spins freely. The top-end was removed and inspected. Some cleaning. sanding and polishing of the engine covers.

Wherever possible chrome parts were cleaned and polished. However, none of these will be mirror finish.

A significant number of new parts are included, including:
Front and Rear Tubes and Tires
Gaskets
Rubber Pegs

I don’t reuse rusted hardware, so with the exception of the rusted nuts, bolts and washers, pretty much all the parts you need for a restoration are included.

If this is your first restoration project, I’m happy to help with advice, share some restoration tools and give pointers to parts sources or service providers.

So what do you get? A rolling chassis, seat, tank, engine, a couple of boxes of parts and a shop manual. And someday, you’ll have a great little bike with tons of “eye pop.” Plan on lots of smiles.

Steering, handling and brakes were a major overhaul over the previous year’s R and non-R models. It was intended to give an owner a good track day mount by including the handling upgrades and a Lap Timer built into the Dash Menu.

At 382#’s dry, the bike’s rated 106 HP and low reciprocation drivetrain mass make for more fun than a barrel of Monkeys. This is a Hooligan’s bike and what a great street ride. The weight is not in the wrists, you can manage your weight through your feet. The upright sitting position will make for a longer day in the saddle then one with most of your weight being pushed into the handle bars.

Our particular bike has some nice Triumph Factory Options installed. There are Billet Bar End Mirrors along with Shortie Levers. A SC Project Slip-On Exhaust really accents the Triples Growl as RPM’s build along with a tinted Fly Screen added to the Fairing. Tires look to have about 1,000 miles on them.

Miles on this 2014 Triumph Street Triple 675R are 13,255 and the VIN# is SMTL03NE5ET624094. The selling price is $5,895.

2022 Kawasaki KLX140R
OFF-ROAD LIKE NEVER BEFORE
Featuring confident handling, KLX140R motorcycles are the ideal entry into off-road riding. The easy-to-ride KLX140R lineup offers a 144cc engine, plush suspension and push button electric start, making for great trailblazers.
Features may include:
CONFIDENT HANDLING
LIGHTWEIGHT RIGID FRAME
A lightweight box-section perimeter frame made from high-tensile steel provides exceptional rigidity and strength. The narrow profile contributes to an easier rider grip and smoother movement on the bike. Working together, the highly capable suspension and lightweight chassis deliver handling that exudes confidence.
SMOOTH POWER
ELECTRIC START
The high-revving, 144cc, air-cooled SOHC 4-stroke engine easily starts with the push of a button. Air-cooling eliminates the need for radiators, keeping the chassis slim and lightweight while a 5-speed transmission with manual clutch delivers smooth shifting and acceleration.
RELIABLE BRAKING
FRONT AND REAR DISC BRAKES
Front and rear disc brakes provide strong progressive stopping power. The 220mm front petal disc with a dual-piston caliper is complemented by a 186mm rear petal disc with single-piston caliper, inspiring confidence on the trails.
ADDITIONAL VEHICLE
Low 30.7-inch seat height
7.1 inches of front and rear suspension travel

1998 Honda VFR800 ready to ride!,https://portland.craigslist.org/wsc/mcy/d/beaverton-1998-honda-vfr800-ready-to/7578315070.html,7578315070.0,"02/02/2023, 15:18:48","$3,000","For sale is the first model year of the fuel injected VFR line and the last generation to have gear driven cams! These bikes are pretty unique and are getting rarer every day. This bike needs nothing right now and is ready to ride with a clean title. Its not perfect and has the usual dings and scrapes from 62k miles, but it is mechanically sound and still a lot of fun to ride. These bikes are known to go over 100k miles with regular maintenance. Its been supremely reliable for the last 3 years after I put a lot of work into refreshing it mechanically. I bought a new bike to do some long distance touring and its time for this VFR to go to a new owner.

Here's a list of recent maintenance (not including oil changes):
* Yuasa battery - 1 year ago
* New Barnett clutch plates and springs - 1 year ago
* Chain and sprockets - 1 year ago
* Steering head bearings - 2 years ago
* refresh fork internals (bushings, oil, etc.) - 2 years ago
* Full cooling system rebuild including new silicone hoses and thermostat - 3 years ago
* Fuel injectors removed and cleaned - 3 years ago
* All vacuum hoses replaced - 3 years ago

Modifications:
* During the fork rebuild I had the shop put in firmer springs, and also had them install a firmer spring in the rear for a 200 lb rider
* The bike currently has Convertibars installed which gives you some custom height and pull back adjustment
* PAIR system has been removed properly with block off plates
* Emgo mirrors installed to replace the ugly stock ones that came on '98 and '99 models
* Zero Gravity sport touring windscreen
* Upgraded regulator/rectifier and wiring
* Aftermarket 2 piece seat (Corbin I think)

I have a few accessories available for purchase separately:
* Givi wingrack with side cases and top box (two keys) (SOLD)
* Staintune low mount exhaust with minor ding (the best exhaust for this bike)
* Solo seat cowl that is essentially new

2020 Moto Guzzi V85 TT Adventure Special
FOR EVERY ROAD AND EVERY JOURNEY
The classic travel enduro retains the values and authenticity of the noble mandello brand and promises unique riding experiences, in keeping with moto guzzi tradition.
Features may include:
Travelling to live
The TT acronym, already a part of Moto Guzzi tradition, is an ideal fit for the V85: meaning “tutto terreno”, or all-terrain, it identifies a motorcycle dedicated to travel in its purest and most original form, conjuring up clear images of desert adventures such as the Paris-Dakar. Moto Guzzi V85 TT is the new and original all-terrain that combines style features reminiscent of the golden age of motorcycle adventures with the content and functionality of a modern touring enduro. V85 TT is dedicated to those who, while still dreaming of the Dakar, seek a motorcycle that can also inject adventurous spirit into the everyday journey.
V85 TT: the Classic Travel Enduro
The fundamental concepts at the heart of the V85 TT project are simplicity, ease and practicality, values typical of those 80s enduro bikes. Moto Guzzi V85 TT achieves its ambitious goal of combining a style based on said values with the needs of a modern touring enduro. This is why it deserves the title of classic enduro, dedicated to touring . Its design combines technology and functionality, with typical Moto Guzzi traits to ensure durability. The desire for simple shapes is clear: with no kind of fairing, the V85 TT is defined by the lines of its tank, its side panels and the front mudguard, as well as its brand-new sculpted 90° V twin engine of course.
Chassis: for the utmost riding pleasure and ease
That Moto Guzzi ability to build superb chassis is once again confirmed with the V85 TT. Only the new Moto Guzzi can boast such a solid and precise front end as it enters a corner; only V85 TT is able to give the rider such a sense of control and safety while seeking excitement on the road. Reduced longitudinal development of the new small block engine allows for a very long swingarm, for safe and intuitive riding. The new asymmetric unit in box-type aluminium features a curved left arm, for a very linear exhaust pipe design and a reduction of lateral bulk. The right arm of the swingarm houses the new shaft drive transmission. V85 TT is the only bike in its segment to use shaft drive transmission, prioritised over a chain drive because it makes no mess and requires no maintenance.
A new engine, a future classic
The V85 TT introduces a new Moto Guzzi engine. Its configuration mirrors that of all Moto Guzzi bikes in production today: an air-cooled transverse 90° V twin with OHV distribution and two valves per cylinder, the pride and tradition of the Mandello Eagle. Engine capacity is 853cc, thanks to a bore to stroke ratio of 84 x 77 mm. The most modern of all engines in the range, it can boast a ratio of almost 100 HP/litre. Thanks to its complete new design and the use of materials generally destined for race bikes, such as titanium, the new ""eight and a half"" is able to deliver maximum power of 80 HP and boast an impressive maximum torque value of 80 Nm at 5,000 rpm, with 90% of the torque already available at 3,750 rpm, in keeping with the tradition of the Mandello twin, which has always offered excellent drive even at very low revs. This is the first Moto Guzzi small block engine that can easily reach 8000 rpm, an aspect that showcases its modern and exuberant nature.

Bought brand new for daughter during July 2022, but she likes horses more so this bike barely was ridden. It is basically brand new without even a scratch, and includes spares which I purchased but never needed. It was mostly ridden a few times in the yard.

This bike is built with amazing quality for a kid’s bike, like a miniature KTM. It is narrow which allows kids to touch the ground easily and not catch footpegs in ruts. The hydraulic brakes have kid size master cylinders and levers, it has black aluminum rims with Michelin Starcross tires (14” front and 12” rear), real footpegs and the list goes on and on. The bike with battery ready to ride only weighs 77 lbs! The light weight is the main reason I chose this bike for my daughter over a CRF-50, TTR-110 or similar gas bike. The light weight with top of the line tires and geometry make it handle and corner very well. It’s a good looking little bike.

Seat Height: 25.2”
Weight: 77 Lbs.
The seat height is taller than a standard 50, and a little lower than a 110, it weights about half as much and will smoke a 50 in a drag race and beat all the trail bikes at corner speed. Comparing it to a PW-80 it climbs hills much better.

The power levels and top speed are programmable via the app, and it also has a half-speed switch located behind the engine cover to slow your kid down if need be.

Spare Parts included which I purchased and never needed:
1. Extra quik change battery $485
2. Extra charger $129
3. Spare front brake lever $12
4. Spare rear brake lever $12
5. Spare electronic throttle assembly $27
6. Spare front tube $19
7. Spare rear tube $15
8. Spare grips L+R $7

Spare battery, charger, and parts value $706
MSRP for 2022 Motocross Two $3,250
Total MSRP bike and parts $3,956

Other than an occasional chain lube, there really isn’t much maintenance required.

2022 KTM 890 Duke R
THE SUPER SCALPEL
Still agile, but with more punch, the KTM 890 DUKE R takes all the things we love about the KTM 790 DUKE and turns it up to 11. This is a no-compromise mid-weight naked bike, equally at home on mountain roads as it is on the race track, delivering more power, more torque and more Dukeness than any parallel twin that has come before.
Features may include:ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Developed from the same parallel twin that powers the KTM 790 DUKE, the KTM 890 DUKE R engine has been worked into a fire-breathing, high-performance midweight titan. With its increased bore and stroke, higher compression and higher max. RPM limit, the KTM 890 DUKE R churns out an impressive new level of horsepower and torque.CHASSIS
Frame
Just like the KTM 790 DUKE, the KTM 890 DUKE R's handling characteristics are thanks to the dynamic, loadbearing design of the tubular chassis, which allows it to carve through twisty tracks and mountain passes with extreme responsiveness. Just like every other KTM R, the frame is painted orange to highlight its sporty credentials.ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
The tapered aluminum handlebars are positioned flatter, lower and further forward to increase feeling from the front tire and give the KTM 890 DUKE R a racier riding position. Riders can also tailor their preferred reach with three rotational adjustments and 4 positions of fine-tuning on the triple clamp.BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Bodywork
The KTM 890 DUKE R casts an intimidating shadow thanks to its menacing profile and ultrasharp lines. In the metal, however, it's obvious that this DUKE means business. Compact proportions, loud graphics and a bright orange frame are all unapologetically KTM R.SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
LED Headlight
The LED headlights on the KTM 890 DUKE R combine optimal near-field illumination with maximum light output. Daytime running lights ensure that other road users see you coming, which you undoubtedly will be doing at speed.

2020 Ducati Panigale V4 in classic Ducati Red with Ducabike clear clutch cover, CRG bar-end mirrors, tail tidy, LED turnsignals, and just 6K miles on the dash, ready to rip! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2020 Ducati Panigale V4 Ducati Red
The Science of Speed
The 2020 version of the Panigale V4 boosts performance even further and takes track riding to the next level for amateurs and pros alike.
A series of refinements make for an easier, more user-friendly, less fatiguing ride while simultaneously making the bike faster not just on individual laps but over entire timed sessions. The Aero Pack provides enhanced airflow protection and improves overall vehicle stability, enhancing confidence. The Front Frame, instead, modifies stiffness to give better front-end 'feel' at extreme lean angles.
Ducati and Ducati Corse engineers have crunched the feedback/data numbers from customers all over the world and Superbike World Championship events. Their analysis has led to a series of aerodynamic, chassis, electronic control and Ride by Wire mapping changes: designed to increase stability and turn-in speed, these changes make it easier to close corners and ensure riders enjoy more confident throttle control.
2020 product improvements make the new Panigale V4 faster on the track than its 2019 predecessor. Riders of all skill levels will see the difference. During development on a test ride at the Vallelunga circuit, both an amateur rider and professional rider Michele Pirro benefited from the 2020 improvements with the amateur rider going 1.3 seconds faster and Michele Pirro shaving 0.4 seconds off his time.
The S version comes with Öhlins event-based electronic control; this uses the second-generation Öhlins Smart EC (Electronic Control) system that, exploits the full potential of the IMU 6D.
Features may include:
DESIGN
Aero Fairing by Ducati Corse
Co-developed by Ducati Corse and the Ducati Style Center, the Panigale V4 MY2020 aerodynamics package now mirrors that of the Panigale V4 R. The result; fairings that - in true Panigale style - meet official Ducati Superbike requirements in full.
As in MotoGP, aerodynamic development involved a series of preliminary CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) studies, followed by optimisation on a full-scale wind tunnel model.
ENGINE
New changes for top performances
The Panigale V4 MY2020 features new, specially developed Ride by Wire system mappings with several torque delivery control settings. Track-dedicated RbW mapping aligns rider demand with delivered torque more closely, resulting in smoother, more predictable throttle response.
CHASSIS AND ERGONOMICS
MY2020 changes
Major changes on the Panigale V4 MY2020 chassis have seen the introduction of the Front Frame. Built according to Ducati Corse specifications, the latter features a special suspension set-up with a higher barycentre, an increased chain pull angle and improved use of suspension travel. Thanks to these modifications, the bike is easier to lay into the corner when you ease off the brakes, gets to the apex faster, soaks up any pits or ripples more effectively and behaves more neutrally out of the corner.
ELECTRONICS
Latest-generation electronic controls
The Panigale V4 features a latest-generation electronics package based on a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (6D IMU) which instantly detects the bike's roll, yaw and pitch angles.
The electronics package oversees every aspect of the ride: some controls supervise start, acceleration and braking, others govern traction and others again lend a helping hand on corners and out-of-the-corner stretches.

2019 Ducati Panigale V4 R
The Sound of Excellence
Pure racing adrenaline
The new Panigale V4 R embodies the maximum expression of Ducati values: style, sophistication, performance.
It is the maximum expression of Ducati’s racing DNA, more similar to a racing prototype than any other bike: a forward-looking model that accompanies the rider towards a dimension of advanced riding, made up of curves and straights that run incredibly fast, thanks to the electronics that, like an invisible, magical safety net, allows going beyond the limits.
It is designed to ensure a symphony of emotions, thanks to the new concept of performance: not only acceleration, braking ability and best lap time, but also safety and ease of riding, whatever the level of experience.
In short, pure racing adrenaline under control.
Features may include:
CONCEPT
Ready to get on track
The new Panigale V4 R is a race bike approved for road use and is the technical starting point from which the official Ducati Superbike models derive from and will compete in the 2019 racing season.
ENGINE
Top performance
The Desmosedici Stradale R is a more responsive engine that allows reaching the red area of the rev counter at 16,000 rpm (16,500 rpm in sixth gear) to ensure a greater sprint. This results in 221 HP (162 kW) that react immediately to the throttle inputs, delivered at 15,250 rpm (values referring to EU type-approval), 2,250 extra rpm with respect to the V4 of 1,103 cu. cm. Impressive figures for a 998 cu. cm engine, that becomes even more amazing by fitting the full-racing exhaust Ducati Performance by Akrapovic, bringing the maximum power to 234 HP (174 kW) at 15,500 rpm.
AERODYNAMIC PACKAGE
Racing aerodynamics
The aerodynamic package of the new Panigale V4 R includes: protective windscreen, headlight fairing, and side fairings to reduce aerodynamic resistance, air extractors to reduce operating temperatures in heavy-duty racing use, and the GP16-derived carbon fiber aerodynamic appendices that increase stability in all riding phases, reduce the intervention of electronic controls and increase rider confidence, who tends to keep the throttle open for a longer time and brake late into the curve.
CHASSIS
Design for performance
The Front Frame of the new Panigale V4R, developed in collaboration with the engineers of Ducati Corse, is optimized for racing use with fully mechanical Öhlins steering damper and suspensions, including the new pressurized front fork and the swinging arm with four-way adjustable pin.
ELECTRONICS
Cutting-edge technology
The new Panigale V4 R is equipped with the latest generation electronic package, that manages all riding phases, based on the use of the 6-axis inertial platform by Bosch (6D IMU – Inertial Measurement Unit). The Pit Limiter makes its debut on the bike, limiting its speed when riding in the pit lane.

Starts and runs great.
New battery
Brakes are good

Just over 900 original miles!!!

2 stroke engine
Lots of fun to ride and a very stable feeling scooter.
Lost title


Edit:
I forgot to mention that the common oil pump failure on these Zuma's has been addressed. We blocked the oil supply line to the oil pump, which pumps oil into the carburetor. This is remedied by simply adding 2 cycle oil to each tank full up, or premixing your own at home just like other 2 stroke engine equipment. I actually like this idea as I know what mixture is getting into the engine. 2-3oz per gallon, some say 5oz. It's preference I suppose.
I apologize for the clarification.

1991 Honda EZ-90 Cub

I have owned this unit for over 10 years, and it's been titled in my name the entire time.
The original owners only used it with their Motorhome to get around the campgrounds they stayed at.
There's some minor sun fading you can see in the pictures.

There's probably less than 40 hours of total run time on this 1991 Honda EZ-90 Cub.
Please note that the tires you see in the pictures are the Original OEM tires and are at 85% + tread left.

I brought this 1991 Honda EZ-90 Cub for my Grandkids to ride around my property 10 years ago.
Very shortly after I purchased it - my Grandkids moved to Texas with their mother and their new stepdad.
It's been stored in my Heated Shop out of the sun for the last 10 years - being ridden about 1/2 an hour per year on my long-paved driveway - and always with a new tank of fresh non-Ethanol fuel. I just put a new Sealed AGM battery in it in September 2022.

It's in excellent mechanical condition with very low hours since new.
Starts - runs - idles - and drives perfectly.

I've kept it all this time because it's so darn cool with how Honda built it - and it's very Zippy!!!

- 90cc Two Stroke - with Auto Oil Injection
- Electric Starting - with a backup kick-starter lever under the seat
- Auto Electric Choke - just like a car
- Variable Ratio - Fully Automatic Transmission
- Many built-in safety features for children and adults
- Enclosed Chain Guard

Could be delivered locally AFTER purchase for a small fee - depending on mileage.

2018 KTM 1290 Super Adventure R
UNSTOPPABLE
True adventure takes guts, so KTM’s rally experts brought out the big guns and packed 1.301cc, 140 Nm of torque and 160 hp into the world’s most advanced Travel Enduro chassis. This makes for a mile-munching omnivore, ready to carve its name into any terrain – the tougher, the better.
It is our most extreme ADVENTURE ever, full stop. Full throttle.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Based on the 1,301cc V-twin of the KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE R, aka “The Beast”, the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R is clearly the Alpha in its segment.
CHASSIS
In adding the ‘R’, we add a promise: excellent offroad abilities. So you get a 21 inch wire-spoked wheel at the front, 18 inch at the rear, floating on 220 mm of fully adjustable WP suspension. On top of that, KTM’s signature tubular trellis frame, steel crash bars and a high strength, die-cast, open-lattice swingarm are more eager than ever to earn their stripes. And that’s just the chassis side of things.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
At KTM, individualists are welcome. The bike’s ergonomics can be adjusted to suit the preferences and stature of any rider, wherever they may roam: Two handlebar clamping positions: horizontal +/- 10 mm, Two footpeg positions: 10 mm up and back (diagonally), Hand levers with 5 reach settings
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
The heritage of many rally raid victories, all the latest technology, raw power and great ergonomics come together in the bodywork of the 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Sheer power under full control with the manners of a beast are made possible by the smoothly operating software and electronics. MTC, Cornering ABS and ride modes support your riding gently and almost imperceptible. The only intervention you notice is the smile on your face.
ACCESSORIES & LUGGAGE
KTM know its customers like to modify and to travel, which is why the PowerParts range boasts a huge variety of accessories and luggage options across its Street range of sportmotorcycles – past and present. All PowerParts are developed alongside their chosen machine, meaning that KTM riders only get parts that perfectly complement their ride and provide that important ‘factory fit’ straight from the dealer.

2021 Aprilia® Tuono 660
As powerful as thunder, as light as a cloud
Two universes collide... The legendary Tuona V4 1100 meets the advanced technology of the RS 660 to create the TUONO 660, a motorbike destined to shake up the way you look at the world.
Introducing the Tuono 660, the new generation of a versatile naked sportbike. Fun, easy and a heartbreaker on the aesthetics front, its potent combination of power and extraordinary lightness delivers a truly breathtaking and unique riding experience.
Features may include:
Master of all roads
With five riding modes, of which three provide road options and two are designated for the track, there's plenty of choice for all riding styles and levels of rider, made even more enjoyable by the customisable and easy-to-use electronic instrument panel.
Inimitable style
Choose from Concept Black, Iridium Grey and the rather special Acid Gold, until now only available on the RS 660, but already setting new standards of style and aesthetics in the motorycling world.
Digital bells and whistles
The Tuono 660 sports advanced electronics that would put many superbikes to shame. The Ride-by-Wire throttle makes it a breeze to manage the APRC electronic system that includes multi-level traction control, anti-wheelie, cruise control, engine braking, ABS and engine mapping options.
Daytime Running Lights
Upfront, the bike features triple LED headlights and daytime running lights, ensuring safer, more efficient riding whatever the time of day or night.
Electrifying performance
The latest-generation fast and lightweight twin-cylinder forward-facing engine comes courtesy of the mighty Aprilia V4. Its 270-degree crank delivers a truly grunty exhaust note while the final ratios, which are shorter than those of the RS 660, favour rapid take off and response.

2021 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S Ducati Red
The Fight Formula
The Panigale V4, stripped of its fairings and with high, wide handlebars. This, in short, is the underlying concept of the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that magnifies the thrill of the ride every time it takes to the road.
The result? An unrivalled naked bristling with cutting-edge technology and an awe-inspiring design that oozes pure performance.
The minimalist full-LED headlight captures the spirit of the Streetfighter V4 perfectly. On the one hand, it recalls the front of the Panigale V4 and, on the other, evokes the crazy grin of the Joker (the comic strip character from which the Ducati Style Center drew inspiration for this new Bologna-built naked). Already featured on the Panigale V4 and SuperSport, the V-shaped DRL is another clear Ducati hallmark.
Features may include:
DESIGN AND AERODYNAMICS
Ego Booster
The Panigale V4, stripped of its fairings and with high, wide handlebars. This, in short, is the underlying concept of the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that magnifies the thrill of the ride every time it takes to the road. The result? An unrivalled naked bristling with cutting-edge technology and an awe-inspiring design that oozes pure performance.
ENGINE
High Power
The new Streetfighter V4 is powered by a 1103 cc Desmosedici Stradale engine. In this configuration the 90° V4 delivers 208 hp (153 kW) at 12,750 rpm, an unrivalled power level within the naked segment, perfectly in keeping with the all-out character of the new Streetfighter V4. Maximum torque is 123 Nm at 11,500 rpm, practically unchanged with respect to the Panigale V4. Dedicated engine mapping lets riders safely make the most of Streetfighter V4 performance on the road.
The final ratio, shorter than that of the Panigale V4, delivers a wheel torque higher of +10%, which ensures an immediate response to the throttle command.
Power and torque can be raised to 220 hp (162 kW) and 130 Nm by fitting the full-racing Ducati Performance exhaust by Akrapovic that also reduces weight by – 6 kg.
CHASSIS AND ERGONOMICS
Ergonomics, more comfort, more control
Compared to the Panigale V4, the riding position - with an above-ground height of 845 mm - has been redefined as per the specifications of a naked model. In keeping with streetfighter culture, the semi-handlebars have been replaced by a high, wide bar that, together with a moderated footpeg position, ensures sports-style comfort during inner city rides and the control needed to tackle country roads or racetracks.
While maintaining many of the Panigale's stylistic features, the tail is supported by a steel subframe and has been redesigned to enhance passenger comfort and give the rider more lengthways space.
ELECTRONICS
MotoGP-derived electronics
The latest-generation electronics package on the Streetfighter V4 is based on a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (6D IMU) which instantly detects the bike's roll, yaw and pitch angles.
The electronics package has controls for every part of the ride: some oversee start, acceleration and braking, others govern traction and others again lend a helping hand on corners and out-of-the-corner stretches.

2017 Ducati Multistrada 950 set up for off-road adventuring with crash bars, saddlebags, luggage rack, throttle lock/cruise control, and proper knobby tires, ready to hit the dirt--maybe literally! * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2017 Ducati Multistrada 950 Red
My First. My Last. My Everything
The new Multistrada 950 combines comfort, style and superior performance with an incredible riding ease: this is the ideal bike for those who dream of riding a real Ducati. With its Testastretta 937 cc and 19"" front wheel, the new Multistrada 950 is perfect for riding on all terrain, even for urban daily commuting, also thanks to its low consumption and extremely low ownership costs.
The essence of versatility
Ducati presents the new Multistrada 950, the Bologna-based bike manufacturer's smallest ""multibike"", designed to provide all the excitement of the Multistrada in a way that makes it more accessible and versatile. Designed to put great performance within everyone's grasp, the Multistrada 950 is for those who want to get in some touring (and perhaps enjoy the company of a passenger) and those who want an agile fun bike that's ideal for everyday use.
Design
When the Ducati Design Center started working on the Multistrada 950 the goal was to develop a compact, eye-pleasing bike that had to be, above all else, a true Multistrada. That's why it takes its cue from the two bigger-engined Multistrada family members.
The Multistrada 950 combines Multistrada 1200 and Multistrada 1200 Enduro design features to perfection, taking the ""lightest"" elements from both. The front-on view, with the distinctive headlight, 'beak', adjustable screen, two ‘wings' and tank come from the Multistrada 1200. The rider's seat with narrow mid-section, the passenger seat, rear grab rail, the design of the exhaust and swingarm and the wheel sizes were, instead, taken from the Multistrada 1200 Enduro. This mix has produced a bike with classic Multistrada lines that's also compact, and not just visually.
The Multistrada 950 is available in two colours; classic Ducati Red and stylish Star White Silk. Both colour schemes feature matt grey frame and wheels.
Testastretta 11°
The Multistrada 950 is powered by the already renowned twin cylinder 937 cm3 Testastretta 11°, now extensively overhauled. EURO 4-rated, it has four valves per cylinder, liquid cooling and bore and stroke measurements of 94 and 67.5 mm respectively. Engine power amounts to a maximum of 113 hp* at 9,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 96.2 Nm at 7,750 rpm. The compression ratio is 12.6:1.
*The power values indicated above are measured using a chassis dynamometer. Homologated power data, as quoted in the Bike Registration Document, are measured using an engine dynamometer according to the homologation regulation. The two power values may differ because of the different measurement equipments.

Classic-looking 2016 Triumph Thruxton 1200 cafe racer in fantastic shape with less than 10K miles on it, ready to make a pilgrimage to your local Ace Cafe! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2016 Triumph Thruxton 1200
The all new Thruxton takes the modern classic sports bike to a new level, combining beautifully sharp and imposing styling with a wealth of high-quality details. Powered by the all new 1200c ‘high-power’ engine it delivers game-changing torque, performance and capability.
The combination of head-turning style, spine-tingling performance, unparalleled heritage and character make the Thruxton the real deal and the ultimate modern classic café racer.

The all-new 'low inertia - high performance' six-speed engine features a lighter crank and airbox unique to the Thruxton and Thruxton R. With the pin-point accuracy and instant throttle response of Triumph’s next generation ride-by-wire fuel-injection, fed by authentic twin throttle bodies, the Thruxton spec engine delivers a massive peak torque figure of 112FT-lbs at a low 4950 rpm - an amazing 62% more than the previous generation. With a high power output of 97HP at 6,750rpm, 41% up on the previous model’s engine, the new 1200cc Thruxton delivers much more power lower down and across the whole rev range, with an incredible 68% more power at 4,500rpm.
BEAUTIFUL STYLE AND SOUND
With all of the brooding presence and poise of the original Triumph racers the all new Thruxton and Thruxton R take the modern classic sports bike to a new level. Combining beautifully sharp and imposing styling with a wealth of high quality details, including a slim sculpted petrol tank, single seat set-up and a unique flip-up ‘Monza’ cap, the Thruxton and Thruxton R set the new benchmark.
BEAUTIFUL DETAILING
Both feature a unique fuel tank incorporating a flip up ‘Monza’ cap (a first on any modern production bike), bullet seat and lightweight aluminum bar end mirrors, wheel rims and swinging arm. The Thruxton R features an additional painted seat cowl, polished top yoke, tank strap and clear anodized aluminum swinging arm. There are three Thruxton colour choices, Jet Black, Pure White or Competition Green, and three for the Thruxton R in Diablo Red, Silver Frost and Matt Black.

Linked to the ride-by-wire system the three selectable Mode options 'road, rain and sport' provide the rider with greater control and safety and with the 'sport' mode an even more immediate response.
TRACTION CONTROL
Taking advantage of the sophisticated ride-by-wire system the Thruxton and Thruxton R incorporates a switchable traction control system that optimises the delivery of its outstanding torque.
TORQUE ASSIST CLUTCH
Bringing a light touch and feel to the clutch control of the Thruxton and Thruxton R, the new torque assist clutch system makes it easy to ride, and ride longer.
FINGER TIP CONTROLS
The new Thruxton and Thruxton R switchgear presents a simple fingertip control scroll button for easy access to the key features on the new digital clocks.
TWIN FEATURE CLOCKS
Stylish feature-packed twin clock (speedo and rev counter) with beautiful 3D dial faces cleverly incorporating a digital menu system accessed by a handlebar mounted scroll button. Key features include: gear position indicator, odometer, two trip settings, service indicator, range to empty, fuel level, average and current MPG, clock, access to turn off traction control and ABS features.

See pictures for some minor scuffs on the right side (mirror, engine guard, and muffler) where it was dropped (more like set down unexpectedly) at very low speed on some gravel.

I have had an issue with it dying when it gets hot and it starts back up and able to ride back. Not sure if it's a carb jet issue or cdi, but I don't have time to mess with it. Otherwise the bike has been a great bike and taken care of.

HARLEY DAVIDSON Racer (Privateer)

Year: 1918
Category: Privateer Racer
Engine Displacement: 61.02 cubic inches (1000cc)
Horsepower: 17 HP @ 3200 rpm’s
Bore/Stroke: 3.3x3.5 inches
Engine Type: V2 four-stroke
Head Configuration: F type
Engine Architecture: 45-degree V-twin
Engine Details: Inlet over exhaust valve
Fuel system: Carburetor
Ignition: Magneto
Final Drive: Chain
Seat: Single seat
Dry Weight: 230 pounds (approximate)
Overall length: 51.5 inches
Wheel: 28x2.25 inches Radial spoke
Tires: 28” Firestone white natural rubber
Brakes: n/a
Clutch: n/a
Transmission: n/a

This bike is based on the J Model Harley Davidson. To reduce weight the brakes, clutch, and transmission were eliminated. They are a direct chain drive that are push started. Racers were generally factory sponsored in the early days of racing, but if you were not factory sponsored you were known as a “Privateer”. The paint detail on this bike is based upon a Privateer racer of the day except for the paint color combination which was not adopted by Harley Davidson until much later. The white tires are made from natural rubber and were quite popular at the time. These motorcycles were normally raced on hardwood racetracks and thus were commonly referred to as “board track racers” and they obtained a top speed of over 100 miles per hour.

NOTE: When this motorcycle was manufactured titling was not required and therefore, because this is as racer no title was ever issued for this motorcycle, so it comes with a Bill of Sale only.

2022 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S Dark Stealth literally like new with just 33 miles on it! * Used bikes do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2022 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S Dark Stealth
The Fight Formula. In Black.
The Streetfighter is the result of the “Fight Formula”: the Panigale V4 stripped of the fairings, with a high and wide handlebar, 392 lbs on the scale, powered by 1100 cc Desmosedici Stradale delivering 208 hp kept in hand by biplane wings and a complete electronic package.
The modern and technological Ducati naked bike has immediately enjoyed great success among motorcyclists all over the world, also confirmed by the positive feedback from the international media.
For 2021 Ducati presents the Streetfighter V4 S in a new Dark Stealth color scheme, which joins the sporty Ducati Red.
Features may include:
DESIGN
Powerful and thrilling
The Panigale V4 stripped of its fairings and with high-and-wide handlebar. This is the design concept behind the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that can amplify the emotions of its rider and make them feel like the leader of the pack on every outing on the road. The result is an unrivalled, contemporary, technology-packed naked bike, with a powerful and exciting design that does nothing to hide its performance.
RACING DERIVED AERODYNAMICS
Aerodynamics
Fast, agile mixed-road performance demands maximum stability at high speed and when braking, reduced wheel-up during acceleration and minimized electronic control of the suspension set-up: that's why Ducati Corse specialists have, together with the Ducati Style Centre, developed biplane wings for the Streetfighter V4.
The aerodynamics were developed using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. The calculation method involved stationary simulation of flow and pressure to achieve increased downforce, especially on the front wheel.
MOTOGP-DERIVED
Engine
The arrival of the 2021 Streetfigher V4 keeps the maximum power and torque values.
The Streetfighter V4 delivers 208 HP (153 kW) at 13,000 rpm and a torque of 122.5 Kgm (123 Nm) at 9,500 rpm. These values, obtained thanks to a new calibration and the new exhaust, make the bike even more enjoyable on the roads all curves
MORE COMFORT, MORE CONTROL
Chassis and ergonomics
Compared to the Panigale V4, the riding position - with an above-ground height of 845 mm - has been redefined as per the specifications of a naked model. In keeping with streetfighter culture, the semi-handlebars have been replaced by a high, wide bar that, together with a seat with 60 mm of foam thickness and moderated footpeg position, ensures sports-style comfort during inner city rides and the control needed to tackle country roads or racetracks.
While maintaining many of the Panigale's stylistic features, the tail is supported by a steel subframe and has been redesigned to enhance passenger comfort and give the rider more lengthways space.

2021 Yamaha Super Tenere ES, totally original with just over 7K miles on the odometer, super clean and ready to satisfy your cravings for adventure. * Used bikes typically do not have warranty, but coverage can be purchased for additional cost.

2021 Yamaha Super Tenere ES
GO BEYOND
Rugged, durable and built for superior long distance adventure touring and exploring beyond the pavement.
Features may include:
Compact and Powerful Engine
With an exceptionally compact 1199cc parallel twin and a unique 270° crank for excellent torque and traction, the Super Ténéré® ES is built for adventure. Engine mass is kept low for great handling. Narrow 2-cylinder inline engine is slim and compact for carving tight lines in twisty mountain roads.
Electronic Suspension
Electronically adjusted suspension makes finding the right setting as easy as pushing a button. With four pre-load settings, three damping presets and an additional seven fine-tuning damping adjustments, the Super Ténéré ES suspension can be dialed perfectly to meet the needs of the rider, passenger and cargo amount and terrain.
ENGINE
Crossplane Crankshaft Engine
The 1199cc parallel twin, liquid-cooled engine features a unique 270° crossplane crankshaft for superior traction. It’s almost like having a big-bore thumper without the uncomfortable vibration.
Adventure-Ready Motor
The compact engine design uses a dry-sump oil supply inside the crankcase to boost ground clearance while a side-mounted radiator makes the Super Ténéré ES surprisingly narrow, protecting it from rocks and debris.
Advanced Fuel Injection
The downdraft twin bore fuel injection system with 12-hole injectors is tuned for on- or off-road adventures and is equally made for at-home commuting as it is on long stretches of open highway.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Robust Steel Chassis
The steel frame is designed to reduce rider fatigue during long rides. Using a steel main frame offers the best balance of strength and flexibility, so it can help absorb jolts from uneven road surfaces.
Assured Braking
The ABS and Unified Brake System (UBS) work together to help prevent wheel lock during braking. This system allows the rider to operate front and rear brakes together by simply pulling the front brake lever, which is especially helpful when riding while standing on the pegs. Applying the rear brake first overrides UBS to provide traditional separate front and rear brake control.
ADDITIONAL

2018 Aprilia® Dorsoduro 900
THRILL GENERATOR
The supermotard from Aprilia evolves with the sole objective of providing maximum riding fun.
Dorsoduro 900 is born out of Aprilia's solid tradition in this motorcycle segment and it is a true thrill generator.
A revamped twin-cylinder with 90 nm of torque combined with bar-setting chassis architecture enhances its distinctive characteristic as a fun bike
Full multimap ride-by-wire, traction control and abs round out a technical package par excellence Aprilia Dorsoduro is the fun bike par excellence. Born out of an ingenious intuition by Aprilia, it was built with the sole objective of providing the most possible road riding fun, drawing from the best characteristics of sport bikes and supermotards.
Features may include:
The design: balancing point between form and function
The Aprilia Dorsoduro 900 project places riding fun at the centre of its focus: for this reason, the superstructures are reduced to the minimum indispensable, as anything that is not essential for performance and maximum riding pleasure has been foregone. The technical elements, on the other hand, play a fundamental role, becoming a fundamental part of the design. It is not just the hand guards on the handlebar and the number plate on the front that highlight the close bond with the racing world. The shape of the centre area, the one that most involves the rider during sporty riding, also highlight the design created to achieve optimized and compact dimensions that allow the rider to find the right feeling straight away. Aprilia engineers achieved this result by designing a long and flat saddle, clearly derived from the sports world, capable of ensuring the most effective riding position at all times and allowing plenty of room for longitudinal movement.
New electronic management
Electronic engine management is now handled by the new and more powerful Marelli 7 SM ECU, the same hardware used on the V4 bikes from Noale, that dialogues with the new full Ride-by-wire electronic accelerator system, completely built into the throttle grip. This system allows even more accurate management of the fuel/air mixture and the injection throttle valve opening based on numerous parameters including engine speed, gearbox position, air flow (in quantity and speed), throttle grip and temperature, with great benefits in terms of smooth riding without opening/closing jerks, containment of harmful emissions and fuel consumption. The engine is, therefore, always able to distribute the ideal torque and provide the best acceleration, all to the advantage of a satisfying and fun ride. The system also allows a weight reduction of 550 grams compared to the previous Ride-by-wire that equipped the Dorsoduro 750.
Better performance from the revamped V-twin engine
Starting from the 750 cc 90° V-twin engine base, well-known and popular because of its character and reliability, Aprilia developed a new 900 cc unit with the goal of obtaining more torque and response at low and medium rpms for a thrilling riding experience

ONE FOR ALL
The 390 Duke breathes life into values that have made motorcycling so amazing for decades. It combines maximum riding pleasure with optimum user value and is superior everywhere where really nimble handling counts. Light as a feather, powerful and packed with state-of-the-art technology, it guarantees undreamed of dynamic fun, whether you're in the urban jungle or a forest of bends. 390 Duke– nowhere you will find more motorcycle for your money.
Features may include:
BRAKES
A state-of-the-art Bosch 9MB ABS makes the pleasure of the impressive Duke dynamics even safer and adds the finishing touch to its peerless chassis qualities. The ABS on the KTM 390 Duke monitors the effect of the potent brake system with radially-bolted, four-piston calliper and 300 mm disc diameter - fun with no regrets, developed in close collaboration with the specialists from Bosch and Brembo. And for the stunt riders among us: the ABS is naturally disengageable.
FRAME
32 kW (44 hp) power plus a dry weight of only 139 kg guarantee immense, agile riding fun with the new 390 Duke. The first-class chassis, with lightweight still trellis frame in the proven KTM design, turns it into a real surfer through the bends. Masses grouped close to the centre of gravity maximise manoeuvrability and precision – and prepare the 390 Duke perfectly for the rush hour slalom.
TELESCOPIC FORK
The KTM 390 Duke's high-quality upside-down fork from WP Suspension has the same 43 mm outer tube diameter as the RC8 R – in other words: real racing equipment that guarantees highest levels of stability and precision.
WHEELS AND TYRES
Equally lightweight and delicate as they are stable, the 17 in cast light alloy wheels are fitted with grippy Metzeler tyres - 110 mm wide at the front and an impressive 150 mm at the rear. The tyres impress with tremendous grip in both wet and dry conditions, as well as providing supreme durability.
SWINGARM
The 390 Duke's lightweight, high-quality, pin-jointed, die-cast swingarm is designed and produced according to the same principle as the 690 Duke. The light alloy swingarm with directly linked WP shock absorber excels with extreme torsional stiffness and outstanding tracking stability.
INJECTION
The intricate engine design, state-of-the-art injection electronics and the close-ratio, six-speed transmission not only help the KTM 390 Duke to achieve impressive performance, but also extremely low fuel consumption. Thanks to the regulated catalytic converter, it produces only minimal emissions.
FUEL TANK
The shapely 11 l fuel tank of the 390 Duke not only provides the rider with perfect knee contact, but also with a greater range, even when ridden on the edge, thanks to the economic engine.

2019 Honda® Rebel 300 ABS
WHY CONFORM? REBEL!
Forget all that bigger is better stuff. Sometimes light and nimble is the way to go—and that’s what we’re talking about with a Honda Rebel 300. Light, nimble—and awesome. Because a Rebel 300 embraces all the parts of motorcycling that we love. It’s minimal, but turns that minimalism into a free sense of style. Designed for riders of all skill levels, it rocks a sporty, narrow single-cylinder engine. Its blacked-out touches let you use it like a blank canvas, so you can customize it to make it your own. The low seat, plus great new color options this year—who doesn’t love that? Do more with less, but do it better. The Rebel 300 is ready.
Features may include:
SPORTY ENGINE
Hondas are famous for their engines, and we’ve given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce the overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
SUPERIOR HANDLING
A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.

Nice Nice Nice - Low Miles - A must see - Gorgeous paint

2014 Victory Motorcycles® Vision® Tour Gloss Black
The Victory Vision redefines what a touring motorcycle can be with its outstanding combination of a great ride, ample storage, superior comfort and distinctive style that could only come from Victory Motorcycles.
Standard Features May Include:
106 Cubic-Inch Freedom® V-Twin
The Victory® Freedom® 106/6 V-Twin is a 106-ci powerplant that provides Victory Vision Tour riders with 108 ft-lb of torque. Smooth, powerful, and efficient, it’s a counter-balanced and fuel-injected engine that delivers confidence-inspiring performance for touring riders who like to lead, not follow.
6-Speed Overdrive Transmission
Every gear shift is smooth and defined with the Victory 6-speed transmission with true overdrive. It syncs up with the outstanding power of the Victory Freedom® 106/6 V-Twin and its helical-cut gears ensure that each shift is sure and smooth. During interstate cruising, 6th gear overdrive drops the RPMs and delivers the smooth ride you’ve been looking for, and to enhance fuel mileage and extend the range of a tank of fuel.
Heated Handgrips & Individual Heated Seats
Extend the riding season with the heated handgrips and heated seats. There’s a choice of Hi & Lo settings for the heated handgrips, and the heated seats have individual driver and passenger controls with Hi & Lo settings. You can add a month or more on both ends of the riding season with the flip of a switch.
29 Gallons Of Trunk & Saddlebag Space
Integrated in the smooth-flowing lines of the Victory Vision Tour are convenient side storage compartments and a spacious trunk. These storage spaces combine to offer one or two riders ample space for their touring gear. The side compartments and trunk are weather-sealed and lockable. The trunk has an integrated, padded passenger backrest and dual audio speakers that combine with the fairing speakers for surround sound.
Confidence-Inspiring Linked Abs Braking
Victory Vision Tour riders ride with confidence, knowing their stopping power includes the Victory Linked Anti-Lock Brake System. It monitors the wheels and when it senses compromised traction, it instantly and automatically provides braking for quick stopping under control.
Cruise Control
Once you’re out on the open road, activate the cruise control to enjoy easy, relaxed cruising. This automotive-quality cruise control is easy to activate and set, and it reliably maintains the desired speed. To de-activate it, simply press “Off” or engage the clutch or brake.
Power Windshield & Full-Coverage Frame Mounted Fairing
With the power windshield, you manage airflow reaching the riders by raising and lowering the windshield with the push of a button. The frame-mounted fairing provides the ultimate in wind and weather protection and lets riders enjoy the ride in all conditions.
Ultra-Smooth Rear Suspension Travel
If you encounter a rough patch of road, the plush Victory Vision Tour rear suspension keeps the ride smooth and steady with 3.65” of travel. Keep the ride consistently smooth with the easy-adjust air shock. Consult the air pressure chart, adjust the air shock with a hand pump and enjoy the incredibly smooth ride whether you’re riding solo or 2-up, with or without cargo on board.

Start up easy, sounds good! Stop by and check it out!

2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression “box bridge” piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS® or Android® device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike’s onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB® coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB® shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha’s unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8” aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

2022 Honda® Shadow Phantom
STEALTH PERFORMANCE
Honda’s Shadow Phantom makes a point of standing out by not trying to stand out. In a world of look-at-me noise, its understated, confident style is a perfect match for what this bike is all about: performance, ride quality, practical muscle, and above all straight-up riding fun. Subtle visual highlights include spoked wheels, black rims, bobbed fenders and matte black accents. Then there’s the engine, a blacked-out 745cc V-twin with a throaty twin exhaust, built to deliver the wide torque spread every cruiser rider wants. New colors this year keep it fresh, and the low seat height and pullback handlebar keep it comfortable. Pure Honda, pure performance, pure cool. The Shadow Phantom is exactly what you want from a modern cruiser.
Features may include:PERFORMANCE
V-TWIN ENGINE
Nothing pumps out the torque like a bold V-twin. The Phantom’s power makes it perfect for around-town cruising, commutes and casual weekend-long rides.STYLE
STYLISH FINISH
Bobber-inspired styling with extensive blacked-out and matte finishes.
SHORTY FRONT FENDER
Minimalist front fender gives the Shadow Phantom a lighter, cleaner, more progressive look.COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
Skimming the pavement at just 25.8 inches, the Phantom’s low seat height makes flat-footing it at stoplights or in parking lots a breeze. And the Phantom’s narrow seat/tank junction makes it feel even lower.
GUNFIGHTER SADDLE
Sleek, one-piece gunfighter-type seat is comfortable and looks great too.DRIVETRAIN
SHAFT FINAL DRIVE
Clean, efficient, proven, low-maintenance. Shaft final drive is the perfect choice for a machine like this, and for riders who pile on the miles. You never have to worry about lubrication or adjustment out on the road. And an added plus: it helps keep your bike cleaner, too.
2-INTO-2 EXHAUST SYSTEM
Sleek pipes feature bullet-style mufflers for that classic cruiser style of yesteryear. Large-diameter head pipes and 2-into-2 system design combine to put out true, V-twin cruiser sound.ENGINEERING
FRONT-DISC BRAKE
If there’s one place you don’t want retro performance, it’s your brakes. That’s why we gave the Shadow Phantom a 296mm front disc for distinctly modern stopping power.

2022 Honda® CRF450R-S
HOLESHOT PERFORMANCE. CHAMPIONSHIP VALUE.
This year, we’re happy to announce an extraordinary opportunity for motocross riders: The 2022 Honda CRF450R-S, a new machine built to the proven 2020 CRF450R specs. But here’s the best part: We’re also offering it at a greatly reduced price that’s going to make it one of the best dirtbike deals ever.
The CRF450R-S offers a spectacular list of features, like our balanced twin exhaust for riders who prefer that system. And the Unicam® engine, selectable engine modes, Honda Selectable Torque Control and HRC Launch Control all put this bike right at the front. And if you do your part, it’ll put you there, too.
Features may include:HANDLING
NEXT-GENERATION ALUMINUM FRAME
The CRF450R-S’s Next-Gen twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock’s mounting point lower, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity for more holeshots. The frame geometry also helps improve traction, feeling and steering precision.ENGINEERING
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We’re talking about a special ECU here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF450R-S will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!CONVENIENCE
ELECTRIC STARTER
Kickstarting? Maybe if you’re riding in the vintage class, but not here. By ditching the kickstarter entirely, our engineers can make the CRF450R-S lighter. Electric starters and lithium-ion batteries are so light now and so good that putting them on a bike like this is a win/win combination. And winning is what a CRF450R-S is all about.PERFORMANCE
449cc UNICAM ENGINE
Honda’s Unicam cylinder head combines the best of single- and double-overhead-cam designs. The configuration contributes to a compact engine that saves weight over a comparable dual-overhead-camshaft motor and also permits a narrow included valve angle. This flattens the combustion chamber to facilitate ignition flame propagation, allowing a high compression ratio. Since less space is taken up in the cylinder head, the camshaft sits lower in the head for a more compact engine and a lower center of gravity.

2023 Honda® CRF125F - Big Wheel
BIGGER WHEELS, BIGGER FUN
No matter what the sport, if you want to perform your best, you need equipment that fits. And that’s exactly why we offer the CRF125F Big Wheel: It combines the rider-friendly power of a 125 with an overall bike size that fits some taller riders better, providing a great match for both a rider's skill and height. It’s really a genius concept—we take our CRF125F and fit it with a longer swingarm and larger diameter wheels. That raises the seat height by about two inches. What doesn’t change is our proven Honda single-cylinder engine, featuring fuel injection for broader power and better running in cold weather and high altitudes. There’s also a four-speed transmission and a twin-spar steel frame, along with plenty of suspension travel. And did we mention the electric starter? Plus, if you’re looking for the same great bike, but in a slightly smaller overall package, check out our CRF125F. Try them both—you can’t go wrong here!
Features may include:
BIGGER WHEELS
With a 19-inch front wheel and a 16-inch wheel in the rear, the CRF125F Big Wheel will fit taller riders a little better. The right-sized bike is as important as wearing the right-sized boots or helmet.
HALF-WAFFLE GRIPS
Just like the pros use, the CRF125F Big Wheel gets half-waffle pattern grips. Might as well start them off right!
RELIABLE ENGINE
The CRF125F Big Wheel’s dependable four-stroke single-cylinder engine offers good performance with a wide powerband—perfect for a range of riders, including beginners. Fuel injection makes it even better and more efficient.
PRO-LINK® REAR SUSPENSION
Progressive linkage connects a single heavy-duty shock to the swingarm, delivering an excellent combination of spring and damping rates over a wide range of riding conditions.
PROVEN MANUAL CLUTCH
The heavy-duty Honda clutch is durable and helps promote smooth shifting.

2023 Honda® CRF150R
GET OFF TO THE RIGHT START
Some people don’t take small motorcycles seriously. But that’s definitely not the case with the 2023 Honda CRF150R and CRF150R Expert. And you’ll know that for a fact the first time you ride one—or try to race against one! It all starts with the high-performance Unicam® engine, a Honda exclusive that’s light, compact, high-revving and powerful. Inspired by our open-class CRF450R’s engine, it also offers legendary Honda quality and dependability—just the thing for a long racing season. What’s the difference between these two bikes? Our Expert model uses the same great engine and frame, but features bigger wheels, a longer swingarm and higher seat to better suit taller riders.
Features may include:
POWER
UNICAM® ENGINE
The CRF150R uses a Unicam engine based on our championship-winning CRF450R. Designed to give you excellent rideability and more power and torque across the rev range, the engine runs consistently at different tracks—it’s an all-around winner.
PERFORMANCE
ACCELERATOR PUMP
The CRF150R uses a carburetor featuring a “direct push” accelerator pump which gives you better, more immediate throttle response.
HANDLING
TRACK-DESIGNED CHASSIS
A lightweight, high-tensile steel frame with large-diameter frame tubing and crossmember delivers excellent turning performance and straight-line tracking.
ENGINEERING
FRONT DISC BRAKE
The front disc brake provides powerful, precise braking.

2022 Honda® Africa Twin
RIDE THE WORLD
Adventure bikes are super-popular these days, and it’s easy to see why. They let you ride just about anywhere. Plus, their upright seating and sensible riding position let you rack up the miles in comfort. But they face a challenge, too: they need to combine state-of-the-art touring and riding technology with total reliability.
And that’s why Honda Africa Twin models are so far out in front of all the rest. Technology? Check out things like Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™, and of course our available automatic DCT transmission. Reliability? Nobody even comes close to Honda there. Comfort? Hey, you’re talking about the people who build the Gold Wing. Off-road performance? Ever heard of the Baja 1000 or the Dakar Rally? All that expertise goes into every Africa Twin we build.
For 2022 we’re offering four different Africa Twin models. Our standard Africa Twin is a great choice for serious off-road enthusiasts, with either a six-speed manual transmission or our optional DCT. For long-distance adventure touring, check out our two Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES models: They offer special features like electronically controlled suspension, an adjustable windscreen, larger fuel tank, heated grips, tubeless tires, and more. They too are available with either manual transmission or DCT. And every Africa Twin in our line features Android Auto this year, along with new control settings and a tasty new color choice.

2023 Kawasaki KLX®230 S ABS
Take the playing field by storm with nimble dual-sport performance that's ready to conquer both on- and off-road. This agile bike features a quick-revving 233cc engine, lightweight chassis, and long-travel suspension. Styling updates include a new front fender and LED headlight. Fuel injection provides easy starting and crisp throttle response in a wide range of elevations and temperatures. The result is a consistent ride on paved streets, dirt trails, and beyond.
Features may include:
STEADY POWER
GO PLAY
The KLX®230 dual-sport lineup is powered by a 233cc fuel-injected, air-cooled single cylinder engine, tuned for low- to mid-range power.
RUGGED CHASSIS
BUILT TOUGH
The engine and chassis were designed together to make the KLX®230 as agile and lightweight as possible.
HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY
BEYOND THE ROAD
Designed from the ground up for dirt fun. That’s why the KLX®230 dual-sport features long-travel suspension, front and rear disc brakes and full-size wheels.
DUAL-SPORT CAPABILITY
TAKE ON THE STREET AND DIRT
Designed for the trails and tuned for on-road versatility, let the KLX®230 lineup take you to new heights with on- and off-road capability.
KLX®230 S
MORE RIDERS, MORE FUN
The KLX®230 S extends the playing field, allowing more riders to experience the thrill of dual-sport riding thanks to a reduced 32.7 inch seat height (34.8 inches on standard model). The KLX230 S is available with an innovative dual-sport calibrated ABS jointly developed with Bosch®.
ADDITIONAL
Lower seat height than KLX®230 (32.7 inches vs. 34.8 inches)
Shorter 2-stage front suspension with 6.2 inches of travel
Uni-Trak® rear suspension with 6.6 inches of travel
UPDATED front and rear Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)

Bike runs great. Very good for exploring the open back roads of rural Oregon, Washington, and California. Comfortable and smooth ride, great for a first bike and for touring. Has been kept in a garage or covered it's whole life. Comes with two riding jackets, cover, and good Shoei helmet.

Selling because I'm downgrading to something for just around town.

ADVENTURE MOTORCYCLE 2023 RX4 BY CSC,https://portland.craigslist.org/yam/mcd/d/valyermo-adventure-motorcycle-2023-rx4/7575609724.html,7575609724.0,"02/02/2023, 15:24:02","$4,995","CSC Motorcycles & E Bikes

The rugged RX4 Adventure has proven itself an unmatched value in the ADV / adventure-touring market, and the addition of an big TFT color instrument panel and new tubeless wire-spoke wheels with electronic tire-pressure sensors makes it even more appealing for 2023!

There is nothing else on the road with the style, versatility, speed and premium features that can touch the RX4’s incredibly affordable $4,995 price. It’s a powerful yet accessible option for riders who desire an economical and manageable ADV bike.

The RX4 includes a huge list of standard features that are typically extra-cost options or unavailable on other motorcycles.

The highlight for 2023 is the beautiful 7-inch TFT color instrument panel that can display tire pressures in real-time and can be linked via Bluetooth to a rider’s smartphone to display incoming calls!

The panel is also customizable to give riders the choice of an analog tachometer layout or a bar-graph tach across the top of the screen, as well as displaying a wealth of other info, including a trip computer with average and real time fuel economy, average and maximum speeds, gear-position indicator, battery voltage, fuel level, coolant temperature and ambient temperature. An ambient light sensor automatically changes the background darker at night so the display isn’t overly distracting.

Other premium features included include full LED lighting, an adjustable windscreen, and a tapered aluminum handlebar. The RX4 also includes adjustable suspension and antilock braking with dual radial-mount four-piston front calipers, as well as the new wire-spoke wheels with a patented design that allows running tires without fussy inner tubes.

The RX4 is powered by a strong 450cc engine that supplies excellent grunt for navigating everything from gnarly trails to speedy highways, and it’s counterbalanced for exceptionally smooth operation. The fuel-injected and liquid-cooled motor produces more than 40 horsepower, enough to easily propel the lightweight RX4 past every speed limit in America.

The efficient single-cylinder engine combines with a 5.3-gallon gas tank to provide a range well beyond 250 miles between refueling stops, allowing your adventures to stretch far from civilization. A robust 300-watt alternator supplies power for any adventurer’s requirements through the included USB and 12-volt charging outlets and two prewired outlets under the seat.

The RX4 is the result of several years of refinement by Zongshen, one of the world’s largest motorcycle producers, and is built to CSC’s specifications to fill a high-demand gap in the dual-sport/adventure market.

""The RX4 delivers the adventure experience with a platform capable of handling anything a rider can throw at it, on road or off, and at an affordable price,” says Steve Seidner, President of CSC Motorcycles. 

The RX4 costs just $4,995, including its wire-spoke wheels with aluminum rims, an inverted fork, and protective engine guards and a skid plate. It also receives a new black treatment for the passenger grab handles and footrests, as well as on the three-piece luggage system that remains standard equipment on the feature-rich RX4.

The RX4’s humble price is due to CSC Motorcycles’ innovative business model of selling direct to consumers. The RX4 undergoes final assembly in our California headquarters and then a road test to ensure flawless operation before shipping directly to customers, with no assembly required.

The RX4 ships to your door for a low flat fee of only $500.00 to most locations in the lower 48 states (some locations may incur additional surcharges) plus assembly and documentation fees, which add just $410 to the price, much less than typical dealer PDI fees. And the RX4 is backed by a one-year unlimited-mileage warranty and a complete set of parts in stock if ever needed.

Nowhere else can you find such a list of features for $4,995, making the RX4 the ultimate value in adventure motorcycles.

“Far and away the most appealing aspect of the RX4 is its price-to-features ratio,” asserted Ari Henning on Revzilla’s Common Tread platform about last year’s RX4 before the 2023 upgrades. “There isn’t a motorcycle on the market that offers so much for so little.”

An aluminum luggage package and many other accessories are available from CSC, including seat options, a burly aluminum skid plate, an ABS-defeat switch, cast aluminum wheels and tire options.

The RX4 is available in vibrant Fire Yellow, Sapphire Blue, Dark Burgundy Metallic, & Arctic White.

2015 Honda CBR500R
Middleweight. Never Middle Of The Pack.
Honda boldly redefines the middleweight class and infuses a whole new level of excitement for sport riders in search of superior value, along with great fun.
The CBR 500R delivers plenty of performance to sport riders, with its thoroughly modern, torquey 471cc P-twin DOHC engine wrapped in a great-handling chassis and featuring a full fairing spawned from Honda's much-acclaimed CBR 600RR and CBR 1000RR sportbikes.
The CBR 500R features a full bodywork cowl and a 31-inch seat height. It's an excellent choice for riders ready to move up a displacement class, or for any rider who's looking for a light, sporting, do-it-all street machine.Features May Include:
Enough Engine For Everything
Choosing a 500 isn't a compromise, especially when it's a powerplant with as much development behind it as Honda's parallel twins. Liquid-cooling, double overhead cams and bulletproof reliability make this a great all-around powerplant for any kind of riding you have in mind.
Sporting Heritage
The CBR 500R offers a riding position that's a touch more sporty, but not too aggressive, whether you're commuting or carving the canyons.
Practicality was never so much fun.
Its combination of lightweight and rider-friendly engine makes the CBR 500R a great choice for commuting, weekend rides, or just getting out and having fun. Plus, its lower seat height makes it easier to get your feet on the ground when you stop.
Accessorize Your Style
The CBR 500R has a full line of available Honda Genuine Accessories including a sport screen, color-matched passenger seat cowl, and carbon-look accents.

The CSC RX3 Adventure motorcycle is perfect for real-world riding, including adventure touring, off-road excursions, sightseeing, or commuting to work economically. The RX3 is equipped with a proven and smooth 250cc, 4-valve, overhead cam, counter-balanced engine. The engine is water-cooled and equipped with Delphi fuel injection and electric start. For maximum performance the bike features a six-speed transmission.

The RX3 engine has a proven record of economy and durability around the world. The engine is also specifically designed to be low-maintenance. This same engine is a best-seller in Central America (where motorcycle sales far exceed that of the U.S. annually.) The RX3 has competed and been proven in off-road rallies in Eastern Europe. This same dependable RX3 counter-balanced engine is also found in the RC3 factory Moto GP racing bike that has competed since 1999 and won the 2002 Motorcycle Endurance World Championship.

The CSC RX3 Adventure is outfitted with an equipment package that includes 80/20 dual sport tires on steel rims, a tall windscreen, adjustable front and rear suspension, Black rear panniers and top case, front and rear guards, steel engine skid plate, and much more that cost hundreds more on other bikes. Other adventure motorcycles force you to buy countless upgrades, but the RX3 includes a comfortable touring seat, passenger seat and foot pegs, LED turn signals and tail light, ABS brakes, a full digital dash with speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, gear indicator, neutral light, and clock plus an analog tachometer. These extra-cost options are all STANDARD equipment on the RX3.

But the CSC RX3 value continues with anodized front forks, wide steel foot pegs with removable rubber inserts, a stainless-steel exhaust, a 4.2-gallon gas tank with locking gas cap, a 300-watt alternator for accessories, 12 Volt charger , USB port and handlebar switches for these electrical accessories. You will pay hundreds more to add any of these options to any other adventure motorcycle — if even possible - but ALL these features are STANDARD on the CSC RX3!

2022 Husqvarna TC 85 17/14
The 85cc class bridges the gap between the junior ranks and full-sized motocross, taking emerging riders one step closer to the big leagues. As such, the advanced hardware featured on the larger Husqvarna range is found on the TC 85. Featuring the latests engine and chassis technology, the TC 85 ensures young riders have the confidence to push harder, while maintaining maximum composure on track.
Features may include:
FRAME
Crafted to provide precise feedback to young riders, the chromium molybdenum steel frame is made using advanced robot welding and hydroformed tubes.
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
Much like the forks on the larger MX range, the WP XACT forks consist of a 43 mm split fork design using a capsulated air spring in the left leg and the trusted oil damping system in the right leg. These components offer remarkable suspension performance with 280 mm wheel travel.
AIRBOX
The TWIN AIR filter can be easily accessed without tools by simply removing the left side panel for quick maintenance. The airbox design allows optimum airflow and maximum filter protection.
COOLING
The TC 85 features radiators designed with computational fluid dynamics to ensure the ideal passage of air through the cooling fins for optimum engine temperature and the highest performance.
ENGINE
Using the latest 2-stroke technology, the TC 85 motor delivers unrivalled performance in the competitive 85cc class. With a lively but controllable power delivery, the motor delivers unrivalled performance and rideability across the RPM range.
CYLINDER
The cylinder is designed around an innovative power valve system, the system controls both the exhaust valve and the sub-exhaust port for impressive power, torque and controllability. As a result, the TC 85 delivers significant mid-range performance, reducing the need to use the clutch in loamy or sandy conditions.

2020 Zero SR/S
Features may include:
SR/S TECHNOLOGY
Inspired by cutting edge aerospace design, the new look of the SR/S is rooted in its all-new aerodynamic fairing. Like all things Zero Motorcycles, form follows function. When you lean into the cockpit and get behind the fairing you will be rewarded with a 13% improvement in highway efficiency and range with the SR/S versus its award-winning sibling, the SR/F. Sit up and you’ll discover a more upright and relaxed riding position that feels as good as it looks.
Elevated Design.
The full-fairing on the new SR/S gives it a premium look that commands attention from the passing to the parking lot. Wrapped tight across the bike’s trellis frame, it envelops a forward leaning rider in its cockpit for maximum aerodynamic efficiency and increases overall range by 13% over the naked SR/F.
Premium Comfort
Thanks to lower foot position and higher handlebar height, riders will enjoy a more upright and relaxed riding position on the new SR/S. Its ergonomic comfort even extends to two-up riding, giving passengers the ride of their life with matching lower pegs and a larger seating area. The fine-tuned suspension adds another level of luxury to the ride.
Effortless Power
The ZF14.4 lithium-ion battery makes the SR/S capable of a 200-mile maximum range with the optional Power Tank. The battery’s industry-leading power and energy density combined with an aluminum heat-sink housing and thermal transfer interface ensure consistent cell cooling and maximum long-term powertrain performance.
Effortless Power
The ZF75-10 motor delivers 140 ft-lb of torque and 110 hp, effortlessly propelling the SR/S to a top speed of 124 mph. Pairing Zero’s renowned internal permanent magnet brushless architecture and a passively air-cooled compact design creates class-leading performance and efficiency.
Our scalable Rapid Charge System allows the bike to be configured for 3 kW, 6 kW, 9 kW or 12 kW of charging at any standard Level 2 charge station.* The SR/S Rapid Charge System charges at up to 38 miles of range per hour of charging (mphc) on 3 kW, 76 mphc on 6 kW, and 153 mphc on 12 kW, which can recharge the battery pack to 95% capacity in 1 hour.
Effortless Control
Cypher III, Zero’s proprietary operating system acts as a hub to integrate all motorcycle systems. It delivers precise performance seamlessly for a consistent and superior riding experience.
Effortless Connection
Customize your dash. Choose the bike info you want and see it clearly on the full-color 5” TFT LCD display. Multi-mode navigation enables on-the-fly ride mode switching, cruise-control, heated-grip* control and much more.
The SR/S is connected through cellular networks, transmitting info to the app at all times. Ride information, current bike status and location are always available. This connectivity gives the rider the ability to monitor the bike in four (4) main areas: Bike Status Alerts, Charging, Ride Data Sharing, System Upgrades and Updates.

I purchased it from a reputable cycle shop in the area. Semi-auto shifting makes this a super easy ride.

I have put approximately 11,000 miles on it total. Upgrades galore.

I have 2 windshields for it, a shorter sport shield and a taller one for winter.
Add-ons: F3 steps, ram mount wireless phone charger, can-am rear seat back with speakers and trunk, front rider seat back, lighting upgrades, cat eye fog lamps, and so much more. You will also get the original back wing that replaces the rear trunk when removed.

Oil changes with full synthetic and new filter every 3k miles. Runs and rides like a dream. Always kept in a warm garage. Tread still in great shape on the tires.

Serious inquiries only. Will need to release title from my lender, which is relatively easy to do. I can trailer the bike anywhere in the pdx after deal is made.

Selling it because I have a new BMW R1250RT and the spyder isn't ridden as often.",gas,11000.0,automatic,,excellent,clean,1330.0,silver,yes,trike,,,,,

Vehicle Comments:
Nice nice nice Harley Davidson Softail Slim - Non ABS - For Sale in Hillsboro Oregon - Ultra low miles at under 1K - Cosmetically very good - Starts up easy and sounds good.

Harley-Davidson's 2019 FLSL Softail Softail Slim is a classic cruiser motorcycle with a sleek and stylish design. Powered by a Milwaukee-Eight 107 V-twin engine, it delivers a smooth and powerful ride. The Softail Slim also features a low seat height and a narrow profile, making it easy to handle.

2019 Harley-Davidson® Softail® Softail Slim®
THE CLASSIC BOBBER HAS BEEN REBORN
A stripped-down, souped-up, bobber with a post WWII era look. You get the power and soul-satisfying sound of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 V-Twin to take you into the future. Fast.
Features may include:
TRADITION HAS NEVER RUN STRONGER
VINTAGE H-D STYLE
The classic look of spoked wheels, chopped fenders and Hollywood handlebars, with a blend of dark and polished finishes.
LOW-SLUNG TUCK-AND-ROLL SEAT
A low-slung solo saddle that matches the bike’s clean, back-to-basics attitude, setting you “in” the bike so you ride like you’re part of it and the open road ahead.
MILWAUKEE-EIGHT® 107 ENGINE
A powerful, smooth-running V-Twin engine with crisp throttle response and a pure, soul-satisfying rumble.
SOFTAIL® FRAME
The reinvented frame retains the classic Softail®lines, but its lightweight design and stiffness translate to a responsive ride unlike anything you've felt before.
SIGNATURE LED FORWARD LIGHTING
Darkness-defying lighting that give you great visibility at night.
HIGH PERFORMANCE FRONT SUSPENSION
Sophisticated suspension technology provides the performance of a racing-style cartridge fork for reduced weight with linear damping characteristics.
HIGH PERFORMANCE REAR MONO SHOCK
Easily adjustable mono-shock rear suspension allows for dynamic cornering while preserving the hardtail look.

2022 Yamaha YZ250FX
YOUR POWER. YOUR WAY.
This Cross Country racer has all the features to win including the smartphone Power Tuner app that adjusts the bike's settings to fit your style and the track.

Features may include:

ENGINE
Competition-Ready Engine Performance
The revolutionary front-intake/rear-exhaust, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected, four-stroke engine has been developed for victories in the highly competitive GNCC® and Hare Scrambles race series. Intake and exhaust ports work with a higher compression piston for a wider spread of power without losing top-end performance.

Forward-Thinking Engine Design
Reversing the cylinder head while placing the intake forward and the exhaust to the rear allow for a straight shot, downdraft intake and straight exhaust port for maximized engine performance.

Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR® Power Tuner to your iOS® or Android® device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike’s onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.

CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Slim Bodywork
The compact bodywork eases the rider’s movement across the machine in tough terrain. The fuel tank provides 2.16 gallons of fuel with a larger fuel cap opening. New graphics are embedded in the body moldings for long-lasting good looks.

Light and Strong Aluminum Frame
An all-aluminum bilateral beam frame provides strength, lightness and durability for cross country racing conditions and comes standard with a rugged plastic skid plate.

Advanced Suspension
Industry favorite KYB® fully adjustable spring-type forks with speed-sensitive damping and a KYB® rear shock have been thoroughly tested and tuned specifically for cross country racing.

ADDITIONAL
Practical Touches
Quick-adjust clutch, wide 55mm platform foot pegs, four-position rubber-mounted handlebar clamps, aluminum handlebars and a side stand come standard for added rider convenience. The YZ250FX is also pre-wired for an optional radiator fan for the most grueling conditions.

Easy Servicing
The air cleaner cover features tool-free access to the air filter. Thanks to a WR-style fuel level sensor in the tank, the YZ250FX includes a convenient low fuel indicator along with an engine warning indicator on the handlebar.",gas,1.0,other,,new,,,,,,,,,,

POWER, TUNED TO PERFECTION
Whether cutting through tight technical trails or blazing across the wide open desert, the class-defining YZ450FX takes off-road performance to new levels.
Features may include:ENGINE
Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
The YZ450FX’s distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design—complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted down-draft intake system—features a cylinder head that works with the frame geometry for optimized weight distribution. Internally, the engine features a straight intake tract, aggressive cam profiles, a high-compression “box bridge” piston design with DLC-coated piston pin and more. Finally, the YZ450FX features specific ECU settings to suit the needs of cross country riders.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR® Power Tuner to your iOS® or Android® device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike’s onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Engine Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps—loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app—to account for changing riding conditions. Map 1 provides more responsive, quicker revving engine characteristics while Map 2 provides smoother response, slower revving characteristics for when traction is limited.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
The upper frame bracing provides rigidity and durability while rear frame spars and cross country-tuned engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of impact absorption, stiffness and rider feeling.
Class-Leading Suspension
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB® coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension uses a KYB® shock with specially-tuned damping characteristics to match the YZ450FX chassis with both front and rear system settings for optimal GNCC® performance.
270mm Front Brake
Large 270mm front rotor coupled with aggressive pad material offer excellent braking performance and feel with exceptional stopping power and controllability.ADDITIONAL
GNCC®-Focused Details
The YZ450FX includes a range of cross country specific upgrades compared to the YZ450F motocrosser including a composite engine guard, 18-inch rear wheel, sealed O-ring chain, fuel level warning indicator and a folding aluminum kickstand.
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
Four-position adjustable handlebar clamps are rubber mounted to improve comfort, reduce handlebar vibration and allow riders to adjust the bar position, while the oversize 1-1/8-inch handlebar is strong but lightweight.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha’s unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.",gas,1.0,other,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meet your new favorite bike
Part of the new CTX® series, the CTX®700N offers a laid-back riding position with more forward-set hand controls and footpegs, and a low 28.3-inch seat height. And we didn’t forget the tech: there’s an available automatic (DCT) transmission and ABS version for smooth shifting and strong stopping in less than ideal conditions. Both versions feature the fuel-efficient 670cc twin-cylinder engine in our award-winning NC700X®.
A Great Lineup Just Gets Better
Our CTX® series is a perfect example of Honda® innovating and moving forward when everyone else is standing still. These superior machines offer the technology and features that modern riders want and need, and do it all at a price nobody can match. Add that to Honda®’s reputation for quality and durability, and the CTX®700N is a machine you can count on for thousands of fun, trouble-free miles.
Incredible Technology, Incredible Value
The CTX®700N offers an automatic transmission and ABS version at a low price. With the DCT automatic transmission, you can shift with the push of a handlebar-mounted button, or select the automatic mode and the bike will shift itself. Plus, you get Anti-Lock Brakes for improved stopping in less than ideal conditions.
Comfortable Cruising
Honda®’s new CTX® series is all about making motorcycling fun and accessible. The CTX®700N’s relaxed riding position and low seat help achieve this goal.
Your Power Partner
The CTX®700N’s 670cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin engine produces tons of torque and enough power for easy two-up cruising. Honda® twins are famous for their wide powerbands and efficiency, and this new engine is one of our best.
Convenient Storage
We want the new CTX®700N to be a bike you’ll want to ride every day, not just on weekends. That’s why we went out of our way to design user-friendly features like the integrated storage—perfect for items you need to access fast.

SOLD AS IS. RUN, AND RIDES GOOD. IN NEED OF SOME TLC. PICTURES COMING SOON 128642853

2014 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Iron 883™
This blacked-out bruiser is a raw, aggressive throwback. No chrome, no apologies—just an authentic ride.
The 2014 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Iron 833™ model XL883N is an amazing way to get started with a custom bobber. From the authentic Harley® 883 cc engine to the chopped fenders to the peanut fuel tank, every piece of the Harley® Sportster® Iron 883™ model has the style you want in your custom bike. For 2014, it comes with a powerful new braking system, optional anti-lock brakes (ABS) and comfortable new ergonomic hand controls. For a combination of style and value look no further than the H-D® Iron 883™ model.
Features may include:
Side-Mounted License Plate
True to the clean, fast lines of the bike, the side-mounted license plate leaves the rear fender surface smooth and uncluttered. Minimal and unique—every inch of the Iron 883™ motorcycle is styled to perfection to achieve a raw, custom look.
Classic Peanut Fuel Tank
As one of the defining features of Harley-Davidson® Sportster® models for decades, the classic 3.3 gallon tapered peanut fuel tank still holds strong today with its traditional styling and modern attitude. Following the line of the bike from front to back, the peanut tank angles down just right into the solo Sportster seat. Attitude and looks all balled up into one.
Evolution® Engine Innovation
Air-cooled and durable as hell, the 883cc Evolution® engine is yet another nod to the unwavering work ethic that drives advancements in motor technology at Harley-Davidson®. Aluminum heads and cylinders lighten the load of the bike and improve air-cooling efficiency. Electronic fuel injection says goodbye to carburetors and boasts increased reliability and less routine maintenance. Bottom line: the rubber-mounted Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of the open road.
New Closed Loop Exhaust System
Designed to meet future worldwide emissions standards, and the standards of future generations of Harley-Davidson® riders. The new closed loop exhaust system delivers heart-pounding performance in the key of the trademark Harley-Davidson® rumble. With its robust, soul-stirring big twin design, new durable mufflers with exhaust shields, a catalyst and mini heated oxygen sensors that improve emissions and drivability, this system is not only better for the environment, it makes riding better.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low, narrow solo seat—just 25.7 inches high—provides comfort and confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. A responsive ride for whipping through town or busting out onto the interstate.
Mid-Mounted Controls
Let your boots fall where they may, naturally to the mid-mounted controls and rider foot pegs on the Iron 883™ model. An easy reach and tight rider triangle is confidence-inspiring for new riders eager to set off on their journey and riders whose legs run slightly shorter than others.

2014 Honda® CTX700
Tomorrow’s Touring Twin
Talk about a bike that can do it all: Honda®’s new 2014 CTX®700 is your new dream machine. Part of our new CTX® series, the CTX®700 offers the comfort and weather protection of a full fairing, as well as a laid-back riding position with more forward-set hand controls and footpegs. A full range of Honda® Genuine Accessories lets you set it up with saddlebags, backrests, and just about any other touring- or comfort-related feature you could ever want. Best of all, you can get the new CTX®700 in two versions: one with our conventional six-speed manual transmission, and one equipped with our unique automatic transmission, the revolutionary Honda® Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT).
Innovations
Full-Coverage Fairing
With its new full-coverage fairing and windscreen, the CTX®700 really adds to your comfort on long trips. The fairing upper and lower components are unique to this model, and are integrated with rest of the bike.
41mm Fork
With 4.2 inches of travel, the CTX®700 soaks up the bumps and jolts in rough pavement, but also provides excellent handling and superior feedback through the handlebar.
Cast Aluminum 17-inch Wheels
The 17-inch wheels give you a wide choice of premium tires to choose from, and really help the CTX®700 handle like a pro on the street. The cast wheels are light and strong too.
Electronic Fuel Injection
Honda®’s Electronic Fuel Injection means easy startups on cold mornings and flawless running even at high elevations.
Reduced Vibration
You don't need to rattle and shake when riding a motorcycle. The CTX®700's engine counter balancer and rubber-mounted footpegs let you enjoy the ride on your commute or on a weekend getaway.
670cc Parallel-Twin Engine
With its cylinders tipped 62 degrees forward for better weight distribution, the CTX®700’s engine is a big step forward in modern powerplant design. The two-cylinder format produces tons of low- and mid-range torque, and the 270-degree-phase crank and uniaxial primary balancer make it smooth, too.
Diamond-Shape Steel Frame
Light, strong, and with just the right amount of stiffness, the CTX®700’s rigid and compact chassis is the foundation for precise handling.
Optional Automatic Transmission
Shift with the push of a handlebar-mounted button, or select the CTX®700’s automatic mode and the bike will shift itself. Honda®’s Dual-Clutch Automatic Transmission (DCT) has been a huge hit on our other models, and once you ride a CTX®700 with DCT, you’ll see why.
Low Center of Gravity
The CTX®700's low center of gravity makes for a more confidence inspiring, all-around riding experience.
Pro-Link® Rear Suspension
Offering 4.3 inches of rear-wheel travel and teamed with a Honda® Multi-Action System rear shock, the CTX®700 eats up rough pavement while giving you a smoother ride.
Integrated Storage Compartment
The new CTX®700 offers a convenient utility compartment that’s in the fuel-tank area, making it easy to reach.
Relaxed Rider Position
The CTX®700 was designed for a comfortable, confidence-inspiring ride. The rider triangle was designed to provide a relaxed riding position for most riders, so you won't feel cramped up after just a few miles down the road.
Low Seat Height
With a seat height of just 28.3 inches, the new CTX®700 is confidence-inspiring and comfortable. Combine that with the forward-set controls, and it's easy to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.

TRACER 9 GT...DOHC...ALL NEW 890CC...LIQUID COOLED...3 CYLINDER...AND MORE
2021 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.Features may include:
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled 3-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The 2021 Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled 3-cylinder, DOHC, 4-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore × stroke of 78 mm × 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900’s frame is 3.5 mm).ENGINE
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the 2021 Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.
Lightweight Forged Pistons
The lightweight forged pistons allow for smooth, high-revving power.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Strong Steel Subframe
The 2021 Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.
Redesigned Lightweight, High-Rigidity Swingarm
The Tracer 9 GT features a new, longer swingarm that is now located inside of the frame. It has a boxed construction formed by welding together aluminum plates. The new swingarm helps achieve both high rigidity and lighter weight, conveying the feeling of drive force to the rider and aiding with excellent traction at high speeds and when cornering.

Nice little stock rebel 300. 1100 miles....needs nothing

2018 Honda® Rebel 300
TAKE THIS BIKE TO NEW PLACES.
You might say this bike is the ultimate balance of performance and style. Designed for riders of all skill levels, it’s equipped with a sporty engine and has an optimal lean angle so it rides great. It also looks terrific with its blacked-out touches, compact frame and low-slung seat. And this year, it’s available in a stunning Candy Lightning Blue. As perfect as the Rebel 300 seems stock, it’s going to be hard to resist making a few tweaks. We say go for it.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
SPORTY ENGINE
Hondas are famous for their engines, and we’ve given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.
STYLE
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
COMFORT
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
ENGINEERING
SUPERIOR HANDLING
A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.

2017 Honda® Rebel 300
WHERE WILL YOU TAKE IT?
This bike oozes style. From its blacked-out looks and low-slung seat, to its compact frame, the Rebel® 300 rocks as is, or makes the perfect platform for customization. But don’t let that steal the thunder from its performance, because it’s also equipped with a sporty engine, a great lean angle and of course, Honda reliability. All together, the Rebel® 300 delivers the performance and style riders of all skill levels can enjoy.
Features may include:
SPORTY ENGINE
Hondas are famous for their engines, and we’ve given the Rebel® 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The new Rebel® is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the new Rebel® has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
SUPERIOR HANDLING
A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the new Rebel® is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.

Ultra nice and low mile 2018 goldwing! A must see!

2018 Honda® Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Candy Ardent Red
THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE TOURING MACHINE
This is a bike 43 years in the making. Rebuilt from the road up. Refined inside and out. Ready for anything. There’s a new engine. New front suspension. Available 7-speed DCT. All in a more agile body that’s over 85 pounds lighter. You’ll also find the latest in technology, including Apple CarPlayTM integration, and five distinct trim levels to suit your style. The 2018 Gold Wing is designed to push the limits of what a touring bike can be. And expand the adventure beyond anything imagined.
Features may include:
PERFORMANCE
ENGINE
The Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. We’ve kept that same overall architecture, but it’s an all-new 1833cc powerplant for 2018, and over 13 pounds lighter (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).
ALUMINUM CYLINDERS SLEEVES
High-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length. The 73mm cylinder bore and short, high-strength crankshaft also help make the engine more compact.
UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGN
The new engine uses four-valve, Unicam® cylinder head design. That improves engine performance and power, and also contributes to the engine’s weight reduction. The four-valve per cylinder design is also a big part of the new Gold Wing’s improved fuel efficiency.
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION
Want a manual transmission? The new Gold Wing offers the best conventional gearbox in Gold Wing history. Case in point: now you get an overdrive sixth gear.
HANDLING
DOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSION
One look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, new Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.
FRAME
This latest generation all-aluminum frame is significantly lighter and more compact than previous editions. State-of-the-art die-casting lets us fine-tune chassis rigidity, giving you both a smooth ride and precise handling.
SWING ARM/REAR SUSPENSION
Using our proprietary single-sided Pro Arm® design, the aluminum swingarm still houses the Gold Wing’s shaft drive. The swingarm links to the frame using a new, patented pivot structure that both increases stiffness and reduces weight. You get responsive handling and a smoother ride.
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
Have to make a hard stop, fully loaded and two up? All new 2018 Gold Wings are equipped with combined anti-lock brakes for excellent stopping power under a wide variety of road and traction conditions.
ENGINEERING
THROTTLE BY WIRE
The 2018 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system affords a degree of engine control you’ve likely never before experienced. It also enables features like our power delivery modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) which you’ll find on our Gold Wing Tour models.

Vehicle Comments:
A very nice rebel 500 for sale in Hillsboro Oregon with just a bit over 4K miles. Must see. The 2017 Honda Rebel 500 is a cruiser-style motorcycle that is known for its compact size, low seat height, and accessible power delivery. It features a 471cc parallel-twin engine that produces strong torque at low revs, making it easy to ride for both novice and experienced riders. The motorcycle has a classic cruiser design, with a low, forward-set footpegs and a relaxed riding position that allows for comfortable and easy maneuverability. It also has a number of modern features, including a digital instrument panel, LED lighting, and a fuel-efficient engine. The Rebel 500 is a versatile and reliable motorcycle that is suitable for both city riding and longer distance touring.

2017 Honda® Rebel 500
You don’t buy this bike. You make it yours.
The Rebel® 500 is a true triple threat: part impressive performance, part minimalist good looks and completely fun to ride. The first thing you’ll notice about the Rebel® 500 is its subtle, blacked-out looks. From the compact frame to its low-slung seat, it’s just cool. Once you get on, you’ll know immediately that this bike was meant to be ridden, thanks to an impressive lean angle, and a 471cc parallel-twin engine tuned for middle and upper-rpms. Ride it stock. Trick it out. Either way, this bike just feels right.Features may include:
SPORTY ENGINE
Twin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the new Rebel® 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the 471cc Rebel® 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.
BLACKED-OUT STYLE
The new Rebel® is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.
LOW SEAT HEIGHT
When it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the new Rebel® has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.
SUPERIOR HANDLING
A lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the new Rebel® is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.

ACCELERATOR PUMP
The CRF150R uses a carburetor featuring a “direct push” accelerator pump which gives you better, more immediate throttle response.HANDLING
TRACK-DESIGNED CHASSIS
A lightweight, high-tensile steel frame with large-diameter frame tubing and crossmember delivers excellent turning performance and straight-line tracking.
PRO-LINK® REAR SUSPENSION
The CRF150R’s Pro-Link® rear-suspension system features a fully adjustable Showa® shock for superb bump absorption and wheel control.ENGINEERING
FRONT DISC BRAKE

LIGHTWEIGHT WHEELS

2020 Honda® CRF450RWE
HOLESHOT HUNGRY. PODIUM READY.
Honda’s incredible CRF450R just keeps getting better and better. And if you’re looking to dominate the 450 class, this is the bike you want. A whole selection of updates this year make the bike look and handle even better.
Then there’s the limited-production CRF450R Works Edition. The RWE gets all the improvements of the CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID DirtStar LT-X rims, a new, exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system with titanium header, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, a factory-spec gripper seat, and more.
Features may include:
HANDLING
NEXT-GENERATION ALUMINUM FRAME
The CRF450R’s Next-Gen twin spar aluminum frame positions the rear shock’s mounting point lower, opening up the airbox area and contributing to a lower center of gravity for more holeshots. The frame geometry also helps improve traction, feeling and steering precision.
ENGINEERING
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We’re talking about a special ECU here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF450R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
CONVENIENCE
ELECTRIC STARTER
Kickstarting? Maybe if you’re riding in the vintage class, but not here. By ditching the kickstarter entirely, our engineers can make the CRF450R lighter. Electric starters and lithium-ion batteries are so light now and so good that putting them on a bike like this is a win/win combination. And winning is what a CRF450R is all about.
PERFORMANCE
EXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITION
Homologated for racing and available in limited numbers, the CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the improvements of this year’s CRF450R plus a special hand-ported cylinder head, black DID DirtStar LT-X rims, an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium header, titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs and shock shaft, an RK gold chain, special ECU settings, black triple clamps, revalved suspension, a factory-spec gripper seat, and an HRC decal package.

I bought it new in April 2020 and have enjoyed it for the 1,300 miles I've ridden it, but now this monster Italian muscle cruiser is just too heavy for me (I'm 64 with injuries) because its main use is riding with my wife (combined weight of the bike, wife, and me exceeds 1,000 lbs).

https://youtube.com/shorts/iB8YvT4TQoQ

It's stock except for:
- Moto Guzzi knurled aluminum footpegs (got originals)
- Protaper genuine flat track handlebars with Domino race grips. I wanted a 1930s board track racer look.
- Solo seat that's 1.5"" higher than stock (I have long legs). I bought a brand new seat and then had it built for me. I still have the original.

To me it looks really cool. The flat-track bars give it a much better look and have more leverage than stock. If you prefer the stock ""dragster"" bars I have them.
I trailered her to GP Motorcycles San Diego to have the first service done because there wasn't anywhere local (then rode it a little while there). It's good to go for another 6,000 miles before the next service. The Audace is a beautiful bike...a real head-turner, but she has to go to someone who can manage the weight.
PS:
- Firm on price. Its a bargain for what it is.
- There's still about $2K in finance through Piaggio/MotoGuzzi. I'll pay it off to get the title once I have a serious buyer.
- I have all receipts, OEM parts, and manual",gas,1400.0,manual,,like new,lien,1400.0,black,yes,cruiser,,,,,

I bought this from a dealer in 2006 for my ex-wife and she never really rode it. Maybe once or twice around the staging area. It was stored indoors and taken out to China Hat as a play bike a few times. Mostly ridden to chug-a-brew rock or a in a round of Moto Soccer. So, in a bout of inspiration and looking for something to do during the pandemic, I decided to splash some money on it and take it Mini Moto Racing at the Mac Track. I bought and installed everything BBR sold to make it awesome. And yet I still have not ridden it. So, it’s time for this sweet little bike to go to the next owner.

The bike probably has less than 10 hours on it total. It’s been maintained and always stored inside. I just cleaned the carb and changed all the fluids and installed a new air filter and battery. The plastics and graphics are all new. The engine is internally stock, except for a few bolt on modifications. Shit I have done to it: BBR Exhaust system, Keihin 24mm carb swap, BBR hotter spark ignition, BBR air filter and air box mods, BBR frame cradle, BBR foot pegs, BBR shifter and brake lever, BBR rear shock spring, BBR Front fork springs, BBR chain guide, BBR braided steel brake lines, BBR front bake pads, BBR rear brake shoes, billet aluminum triple clamps and fork brace, Wrenthal Fat Bars, Crycra aluminum and plastic brush guards and a brand new set of 17” Supermoto wheels with slicks ready to go to the Mac track or terrorize PDX at next year’s Alley Sweeper.

They sell new for $3500 bone stock. I am asking $3900, firm, for a very nice, low hour TTR125 with thousands of dollars of upgrades that have just been installed. The wheels and slicks alone are about $2k to purchase.

2020 KTM 150 XC-W TPI
NIMBLE OFFROAD MASTER
This nimble, lightweight, extreme terrain master is all new for 2020 and now, proudly features the TPI (transfer port injection) letters next to its name. This means that there is no longer a need for re-jetting or mixing fuel, making this easy-to-shred thoroughbred even simpler to ride and work on. Already recognized for its supreme agility, the new KTM 150 XC-W TPI benefits from a brand-new frame with improved flex characteristics that, together with the many other new changes, helps elevate rider and machine to incredible new levels of competence.Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
KTM sets the benchmark in technology with its vast range of race-winning offroad competition 2-stroke models. Two years after the introduction of the world's first 2-stroke electronically controlled fuel injection offroad models, the success story continues with completely reworked, new generation offroad competition engines, all fitted with the revolutionary TPI system. This now also includes the KTM 150 XC-W TPI, further demonstating KTM's unrelenting commitment to 2-stroke advancement. The benefits are clear: besides huge improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions, the system also removes the need for pre-mixing fuel and re-jetting, meaning that with less effort, the engine always runs smoothly and crisply.
CHASSIS
When it comes to 2-stroke weaponry, keeping weight down is key. It should come as no surprise then that the KTM 150 XC-W TPI is one of the lightest, slimmest and most agile offroad machines in its class.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Designed for complete harmony between rider and bike, KTM has exploited the knowledge from decades of race success to create perfect ergonomics on the KTM 150 XC-W TPI. Maximum rider comfort and movement in all conditions is guaranteed. Additionally, the bike features a new tail light design which fits perfectly to the new shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
With input from KTM's factory riders, as well as KTM R&D and Kiska Design, the new bodywork of the KTM 150 XC-W TPI pushes the boundaries of progression even further. The result is a shape across the entire range, that achieves complete harmony between rider and bike. The main goal was to provide the optimal contact points that allow a rider maximum freedom of movement and improved handling. The front and rear fenders feature an intelligent I-beam design, guaranteeing maximum stability with the lowest possible weight. A new tail light design fits perfectly to the new shape of the rear fender and the number plate carrier. The new in-mold graphics confirm the high-performance intentions of this bike, as well as KTM's never-ending quest for race-winning progression.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
KTM XC-W TPI models feature the most modern engine management system of any 2-stroke off-road motorcycle. By reading various sensor data inputs, such as intake and ambient air pressure, throttle valve position and water temperature, the control unit optimizes ignition timing and the amount of fuel to inject at all altitudes and conditions.

There largely hasn’t been a part on this bike that hasn’t been overhauled, improved, or upgraded. This motorcycle is very fun and fast. It’s rare that I’m not approached when out riding and given some sort of compliment. I spent a lot of time on this bike and would be sad to see it go. I’m posting to gauge interest and to investigate the possibility of trades. Interested in trading for sport bikes, modern dirt bikes, toy haulers, trailers, classic cars or trucks. Would be also be very interested in a 2009-2012 Honda CRF450R.

Only 408 miles!
Like new showroom condition.
Only 500 of these were produced worldwide with only 80 or so making it to the U.S.
KTM's are known for being rather tall and hard for many riders to feel comfortable on. This Rally would be perfect for a person that has struggled with tall bikes.
This KTM has the sought after Cone Valve suspension ( $6,500 upgrade ) that has been lowered 1 3/4"" by Solid Performance.
The setup performs extremely well off road with professional tuning and valving.
Set up for a 185lb rider. I rode it on Sunday 10/20/22 in the boise front. I'm 165lbs without gear and the suspension worked flawlessly thru the woops on trail and gravel roads.
Other than my ride on Sunday I do not believe this bike has ever been offroad.
Perfect for a rider that is 5' 6"" - 5' 10""
First service has been performed so you don't have to do anything but ride it for the next 8500 miles.
I suggest checking the air filter after every ride in the dirt.
Extras include a lower Seat Concepts seat bar risers and a Billet case guard. Has quick shift + and Rally Mode installed. Otherwise the bike is stock.
There is a scuff on the left side tank guard from the previous owner. Looks like a parking lot tip over.
No other scuffs or scrapes on the bike.
This bike will not disappoint!

Please don't waste my time with stupid questions and lowball offers. No test rides without endorsement and agreed selling price cash in hand. No off road test rides. I do not need help selling this bike. Wholesalers leave me alone. A text or email with "" is it still available "" will be considered spam.",gas,408.0,manual,,new,clean,,orange,,dual,,,,,

2022 KTM 200 Duke
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT
Thanks to an ultra-compact single-cylinder 4-stroke power plant and a lightweight tubular chassis, the KTM 200 DUKE packs a mighty punch. An updated predatory design proudly displays its BEAST-inspired DNA and shouts DUKE. Make no mistake - the KTM 200 DUKE is an out-and-out street prowling brawler.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Powered by a powerful single-cylinder engine, the KTM 200 DUKE not only delivers intoxicating acceleration but also everyday rideability. Boasting 19 kW (26 hp), it's the most powerful 4-stroke option in its class. Thanks to an updated airbox and exhaust, it meets the highest emission and noise standards, while providing maximum performance.
CHASSIS
Upside-down fork
The KTM 200 DUKE comes with ultra-lightweight, high-performance upside-down WP forks as standard. Using the latest technology, these forks not only perform flawlessly when pushed to the limit, but also allow riders to cruise comfortably on longer stretches of tarmac.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Seats
The two-part seat offers first class sport riding ergonomics with maximum support for both rider and pillion.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Design
There's no denying the KTM 200 DUKE is 100% DUKE. Its aggressive-looking headlight, READY TO RACE stance and sharp lines make it a formidable presence on any street.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
ABS
Single channel BOSCH ABS comes as standard on the KTM 200 DUKE. This means you can ride assured knowing that should you have to brake hard and suddenly - the DUKE has your back.

Only 408 miles!
Like new showroom condition.
Only 500 of these were produced worldwide with only 80 or so making it to the U.S.
KTM's are known for being rather tall and hard for many riders to feel comfortable on. This Rally would be perfect for a person that has struggled with tall bikes.
This KTM has the sought after Cone Valve suspension ( $6,500 upgrade ) that has been lowered 1 3/4"" by Solid Performance.
The setup performs extremely well off road with professional tuning and valving.
Set up for a 185lb rider. I rode it on Sunday 10/20/22 in the boise front. I'm 165lbs without gear and the suspension worked flawlessly thru the woops on trail and gravel roads.
Other than my ride on Sunday I do not believe this bike has ever been offroad.
Perfect for a rider that is 5' 6"" - 5' 10""
First service has been performed so you don't have to do anything but ride it for the next 8500 miles.
I suggest checking the air filter after every ride in the dirt.
Extras include a lower Seat Concepts seat bar risers and a Billet case guard. Has quick shift + and Rally Mode installed. Otherwise the bike is stock.
There is a scuff on the left side tank guard from the previous owner. Looks like a parking lot tip over.
No other scuffs or scrapes on the bike.
This bike will not disappoint!

Please don't waste my time with stupid questions and lowball offers. No test rides without endorsement and agreed selling price cash in hand. No off road test rides.

It was purchased to be my wife's ride but she never used it. I just keep it charged up and start it up every once in a while to keep the gaskets up to speed. Always garaged and kept covered (which comes with it) and we're a non smoking household (not that it matters).

I had it serviced for her November 2021 which included. . . full lube, synthetic oils, progressive fork springs and fork seals and now it needs a new home. It runs great and has a 1832cc 6 cylinder engine that runs on regular or premium gas and a 5 speed manual transmission. I've got to say that the back seat is extremely comfortable. And yes. . . it does go if you want it to.

The pictures will tell you a lot of the story.

Give me a call or text if you have any questions.

I paid $6,500 last year and put $500 into it. New slip clutch pulley, rear chain, belt. It worked perfectly the first few rides then something knocked loose going over bumpy snow.

The high gear isn’t engaging correctly, could be the carb needs to be cleaned or perhaps there’s a sheared roll pin based on advice from Rokon forum members. Should be a very simple fix but I have no clue what I’m doing. It still runs and goes but doesn’t climb or get up to gear the way it did.

However, I doubt you'll find one as deeply modified as my beloved and storied Grendel. This has been my commuter, adventurer and farkle focus for . . . Ten years? Too many bikes in the garage, time to pass it along to someone with similar tastes.
I bought it as a garage queen from the original owner. Over the last 70k I have squashed all the bugs and added all the farkles. A big bore kit and a truly waterproof dual USB port are deserving of special mention. About all it needs is a supercharger. This bike has, and continues to perform flawlessly. True to the KLR mission it doesn't specialize in anything, but it will do everything. A week on pavement in the Southwest or a week on technical trails between here and Truckee. Whether it's gravel roads on Marys Peak or cow trails over to Summer Lake, this bike can do it. The only time it ever let me down was for a factory recall on an electrical short, now sorted.
It is currently set up for my 34 inch inseam, but the stock links are available. There are a couple extra windshields, the stock seat, and my custom attempt at a more comfortable seat. Along with a pile of extra bits. There is also an actual Kawsaki shop manual. I'll even throw in my old torque wrench.
If your looking for flash this isn't your bike. If a bombproof, reliable bike that'll get you places you never expected is more your speed, KLR is the way to go.
As with a fuzzy puppy I'd like to see Grendel go to someone who will take care of it. Whether or not you appreciate the genius of it is up to you. This bike is ready for another 75k, and I'm more than happy to help the new owner work on it and or answer questions, if needed. Endorsement and cash gets you a test ride.

Built on the KTM 690 platform this single is the largest ever put in a street bike. Turn off the T/C and it's a wheelie monster and even 4th gears torque will push you back.

It's an urban legend but really shines in the twisties and absolutely rips up Mary's peak. 0-60 MPH time of 3.6 seconds.
80/20 tires and a bit more suspension travel than it's brother the Vitpilen gives it some fire road abilities.

I absolutely LOVE this bike but my girlfriend hates the pillion seat so I'm shopping sport tourers.

Only 408 miles!
Like new showroom condition.
Only 500 of these were produced worldwide with only 80 or so making it to the U.S.
KTM's are known for being rather tall and hard for many riders to feel comfortable on. This Rally would be perfect for a person that has struggled with tall bikes.
This KTM has the sought after Cone Valve suspension ( $6,500 upgrade ) that has been lowered 1 3/4"" by Solid Performance.
The setup performs extremely well off road with professional tuning and valving.
Set up for a 185lb rider. I rode it on Sunday in the boise front. I'm 165lbs without gear and the suspension worked flawlessly thru the woops on trail 4 and gravel roads.
Other than my ride on Sunday I do not believe this bike has ever been offroad.
Perfect for a rider that is 5' 6"" - 5' 10""
First service has been performed so you don't have to do anything but ride it for the next 8500 miles.
I suggest checking the air filter after every ride in the dirt.
Extras include a lower Seat Concepts seat bar risers and a Billet case guard. Has quick shift + and Rally Mode installed. Otherwise the bike is stock.
There is a scuff on the left side tank guard from the previous owner. Looks like a parking lot tip over.
No other scuffs or scrapes on the bike.
This bike will not disappoint!

The perfect blend of classic, raw bobber style and contemporary power creates a modern ride with unmistakable old-iron attitude.

Features Include:
Hidden Rear Shocks
If you want a comfortable bike but love that rigid-suspension look, you've come to the right bike. Harley kept all the modern comforts where they belong—below the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage 'hardtail' frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It's a signature rigid look, and you'll only find it on this Softail model.

""Hollywood"" Handlebars and ""Cat Eye"" Console, with color fuel tank monitor and heat cover oil cooler
A cutting-edge ride that's rich with Harley-Davidson history, the Softail Slim model's old-iron soul comes alive right up front. Unique retro-inspired handlebars call back to the glory days of 1940s bobbers, while the gloss-black headlamp cover and the ""Cat Eye"" console with its retro speedo face add even more swing-era swagger.

Narrow Rear Profile
The narrow rear tire and chopped fender with its integrated stop/turn/tail light and side-mounted license plate add up to a stripped-down profile that evokes the iconic, no-nonsense style of classic bobbers. Including long shot exhaust pipes for that deep throat sound.

Round Air Cleaner Cover
The gloss-black retro round air cleaner cover gives the Softail Slim® model's minimalist, blacked-out Twin Cam 103 Engine a raw old-school look—it's modern power with old iron attitude.

Pure Harley-Davidson Styling
Feast your eyes on the Twin Cam 103™ engine and there's no mistaking its roots. This is authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through with an attention to detail you won't find from any other motorcycle company. Medium gray engine with black powder-coated cylinders and cylinder heads are topped off with polished rocker covers and an old school round air cleaner cover for a tough vintage Harley-Davidson attitude. It's a jewel machined out of metal. Pure. Dripping with power. From the classic edge of the cooling fins to the clean lines of cases and covers—the Twin Cam 103™ engine makes an ironclad statement about holding on to what's right and staying true to what satisfies",gas,9000.0,manual,,excellent,clean,103.0,black,,bobber,,,,,

Description
The Road King® is where stripped-down, nostalgic style meets the performance and versatility of a modern Harley-Davidson® touring machine. The Hiawatha headlamp and nacelle were born in the ‘60s, when chrome ruled the streets. But the power of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 engine brings it all into the here and now in a hurry. The Showa® dual-bending valve front suspension and rear emulsion shocks put you in control for a plush ride. With cast aluminum Impeller wheels and one-touch opening saddlebags, this is the timeless classic built for today.

Comments for this 2015 Honda CBR500R:
2015 Honda CBR500R
Middleweight. Never Middle Of The Pack.
Honda boldly redefines the middleweight class and infuses a whole new level of excitement for sport riders in search of superior value, along with great fun.
The CBR 500R delivers plenty of performance to sport riders, with its thoroughly modern, torquey 471cc P-twin DOHC engine wrapped in a great-handling chassis and featuring a full fairing spawned from Honda's much-acclaimed CBR 600RR and CBR 1000RR sportbikes.
The CBR 500R features a full bodywork cowl and a 31-inch seat height. It's an excellent choice for riders ready to move up a displacement class, or for any rider who's looking for a light, sporting, do-it-all street machine.
Features May Include:
Enough Engine For Everything
Choosing a 500 isn't a compromise, especially when it's a powerplant with as much development behind it as Honda's parallel twins. Liquid-cooling, double overhead cams and bulletproof reliability make this a great all-around powerplant for any kind of riding you have in mind.
Sporting Heritage
The CBR 500R offers a riding position that's a touch more sporty, but not too aggressive, whether you're commuting or carving the canyons.
Practicality was never so much fun.
Its combination of lightweight and rider-friendly engine makes the CBR 500R a great choice for commuting, weekend rides, or just getting out and having fun. Plus, its lower seat height makes it easier to get your feet on the ground when you stop.
Accessorize Your Style
The CBR 500R has a full line of available Honda Genuine Accessories including a sport screen, color-matched passenger seat cowl, and carbon-look accents.

2018 BMW K1600B Low Miles and Beautiful!,https://eugene.craigslist.org/mcy/d/springfield-2018-bmw-k1600b-low-miles/7580848974.html,7580848974.0,"02/02/2023, 15:31:31","$18,900","Hello, If you are interested in this bike then you probably already know something about it but if not read the reviews. Everybody who rides bikes should own a six cylinder BMW at one point. It has 165hp and 129 ft. pounds of torque with the Remus exhaust and is turbine smooth. I’ve owned over 50 Street motorcycles and this one is probably the best. I’m only selling it because I like to try new things but I will definitely own another one. You may be able to find another for little less money but if you buy one and then add the extras that makes this a better bike it adds up. It has under 6400 miles. It has a GPS and every factory option from BMW including the option 719 forged wheels. They probably don’t add anything to the performance of the bike but they sure look cool. I haven’t checked with Bmw but my dealer said only one in 20 B models are ordered with them because of their expense. If you want to put them on a bike after purchase they are over $4500. The Remus exhaust was $2600. Expensive but it sounds so awesome once you hear it it’s another item you’ll really want. Not too loud at cruising speeds but just a much more aggressive tone. IMO the B model come with one of the worst stock seats of any bike I’ve owned especially such an expensive one. The Sargent seat I added was over $900 but makes the bike rideable all day. And it’s getting better every mile. I’ve owned several Gustafsson windscreens and they are my favorite. The one they offer wasn’t as wide as I wanted so I sent them a template to custom make me one. It turned out great. With the BMWs electric windshield you can raise and lower it to the perfect position for your body and weather. I recently installed some Metzeler Road-Tec 01 tires in the HWM (heavy weight motorcycle) version. Another big improvement. It’s had a recent synthetic oil change and is cross country ready. I have saddle bag luggage. I have the pricey factory cover that’s never been out of the box. I also have the BMW GS 911 diagnostic tool which I’ve never used. All this adds up to a bike you don’t have to add anything to or maintain for a long time. If you buy a bike that needs tires maintenance etc. plan on thousands out of pocket. I have the stock exhaust, windscreen and seat. The bike is in awesome condition. No tipovers. Title is in my hand. I may be interested in trading for a 2020 or newer low mileage Indian. Please no Craigslist Scams. I’ve heard them all. And no test rides without money in my hand. Bike is too expensive. Thanks for looking!",gas,6371.0,manual,,excellent,clean,,black,,sport touring,,,,,

Features nice rear and side luggage racks, compact, High-Tech Engine that combines exceptional reliability and exciting power in a compact, fuel-efficient package. The 689cc fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, DOHC inline twin gives this bike more power and improved fuel economy while the counterbalanced two-cylinder design provides smooth, long-legged power and exceptional handing. A lightweight, high-strength tubular steel frame provides a tuned rigidity balance for nimble, responsive handling with the strength and durability needed to tackle the harshest terrain with confidence. The chassis utilizes a short 62.6-inch wheelbase for agility and boasts 9.5 inches of ground clearance to tackle whatever the trail throws at you. The narrow body and fuel tank also enable the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence whether you're riding on dirt or asphalt. The adventure-ready suspension utilizes a long-travel 43mm inverted fork with 8.3 inches of travel. The beefy inverted layout is highly resistant to flex to maintain precise steering and suspension action, and the fork is fully adjustable to match changing road and trail conditions. The linkage-type rear shock is similarly outfitted for adventure, with 7.9 inches of travel, and a remote preload adjuster to easily fine tune for changing loads or riding conditions.

Bought bike 2 years ago. Was going to convert to a track bike, it’s seemed in much worse when I bought it. It cleaned up too nice, and I didn’t want to wad it up at ORP. Plus, it would take some more substantial upgrades for that that kind of riding. So I’ll keep the track bike I already ride. Runs well, has mega cycle cams, and IMO one of the best looking pipes out there.
Also in town riding 2nd gear will neutral if steady throttle held at 7k and above. No effect when riding normal or high speeds/redline shifting.
Sweet 90’s marker lights(not really). Just installed a used rear inner fender, and need to get some turn signals. Instrument cluster is missing the high beam indicator. Upper front fairing is aftermarket. The rest of plastics are oem, in good shape and both sides have had repairs done.

The goody goods:
All lights work.
Mega cycle cams. Installed by og owner. Top end screams with open supertrapp is fantastic. But run 6 discs for more midrange. Next on my list, was going to be factory pro jet kit. Currently dynojet.
Gas tank is lovely inside. Outside good shape, Ding on top and does have an aftermarket fuel filler.
New fuel lines and filter
Rebuilt Petcock
Kawasaki fuel pump relay
iridium plugs
OEM air filter
Stock air box/ spare air box included
Head bearings greased
Forks rebuilt
Front mstr cyl rebuilt
SS brake lines
Yzf600r shock w/remote reservoir. Better than the og, but still a kidney buster.
Rear suspension bearings, pivot pints cleaned and greased.
Supertrapp exhaust Beautiful
DID 525 VX3
AFAM rear sprocket
Superlight front sprocket
New s21 rubber

Coolant bottle was replaced(oem) when it slid out on the right side.

SUPER CLEAN BIKE, LOTS OF EXTRAS!
2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8 aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

TWO-STROKE HEART, ENDURO SOUL
Featuring a powerful 250cc two-stroke engine and renowned high performance chassis, the YZ250X was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Two-Stroke Power: Tuned for Enduro Racing
The YZ250X is optimized for the unique demands of Hare Scrambles and GNCC racing. The Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS)-equipped 249cc two-stroke engine is mated to a wide-ratio five-speed transmission for the ultimate cross country power plant.
Advanced Motocross-Derived Chassis
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. The industry-leading fully adjustable Speed Sensitive System KYB spring-type front fork is matched with a fully adjustable high performance KYB long-travel rear shock, both tested and tuned specifically for the needs of cross country racers.
ENGINE
Exhilarating Two-Stroke Power
The 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine is lightweight, compact and fun, with an incredibly wide, hard-hitting powerband.
Tuned for GNCC Competition
The YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, revised YPVS timing and a model-specific digital CDI unit compared to its motocross sibling all focused on creating a broad, usable power delivery specifically suited to cross country and enduro-style competition.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
YZ250-Based Frame
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight.
Industry-Leading KYB Fork
The fully adjustable KYB 48mm forks feature the Speed-Sensitive System which uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling, superb bump absorption and 11.8 inches of suspension travel. Additionally, a newly adopted scraper between the dust and oil seal improves reliability in cross country conditions.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.
Cross Country Features
The YZ250X is focused on cross country competition with an 18-inch rear wheel, wide-ratio gearing, standard side stand, sealed O-ring chain, reserve fuel petcock, and newly adopted scraper between the fork's dust and oil seal, all adding up to exceptional cross country performance.
NEW FOR 2023
Improved Rider Ergonomics
To increase rider confidence in challenging cross country conditions, new smoothly integrated body panels, more narrow fuel tank design, slimmer shroud width and flatter seat all combine to enable greater freedom of movement forward and back, allowing the rider to easily shift body weight for better control.
Bold New YZ Styling
Along with the slimmer, more aggressive bodywork, a new front and rear fender design and new radiator shrouds all integrate with a bold new graphics scheme to highlight the YZ family pedigree. Premium Yamaha graphics are now embedded to provide excellent durability and scratch resistance.

2023 Yamaha Zuma 125
COMPACT RUGGED ADVENTURER
The reimagined, ultra-modern, Zuma 125 is a rugged and fuel efficient scooter with big features in a compact package.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Blue Core VVA Engine
Powering the Zuma 125 is a compact Yamaha Blue Core, VVA (Variable Valve Actuation) 125cc 4-stroke engine with 4 valves, a 11.2:1 compression ratio, DiASil cylinder and aluminum alloy forged piston, giving this scooter modern reliability and economical performance. With an amazing 101 mpg and a 1.6 gallon fuel tank, you get plenty of range, too.
Automatic Convenience
A fully-automatic V-belt transmission and push-button electric starting make the Zuma 125 a super-convenient transportation option. Standard center and side stands, along with a locking cover on the ignition switch, make it easy and secure to park, too.
ENGINE
Automatic Convenience
Fully automatic, V-belt transmission with centrifugal clutch provides easy, twist-the-throttle-and-go operation with great off-the-line acceleration.
Clean-Running Design
An upswept muffler incorporates two exhaust catalysts to reduce air pollution and meet emission regulations.
Comfort-Focused Engine Bracket
A reliable steel engine bracket with rubber bushing linkage contributes a comfortable ride with reduced vibration. The link mechanisms are positioned on the underside of the chassis to maximize space for the storage compartment.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Comfortable Ergonomics
A plush and roomy riding position is ready for two, with a narrow seat design for easier flat-footing at stops, and plenty of leg space in front of the rider's seat. Meanwhile, the passenger gets dedicated foldable footrests and secure handholds that blend cleanly into the Zuma 125's body design.
Durable Suspension
The telescopic fork features beefy outer tubes for strength, while fork boots help protect the large 33mm inner tubes from debris. The rear wheel swingarm features twin rear shocks with a full 3.1 in of travel for comfortable riding both on streets and on unpaved roads.
Extensive Fuel Range
The Zuma 125 boasts extreme fuel efficiency carrying the 1.6 gallon fuel tank over a wide cruising range. Its fuel tank emissions system includes a charcoal canister to control gasoline evaporation and reduce air pollution.
Hardy Steel Frame
The robust steel-tube frame is light but strong, and features a step-through design for easy mounting.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Modern Gauge Package
The Zuma 125's stylish LCD meter features a fuel gauge as well as a full range of indicator lights with easy-to-read visibility.
Plenty of Storage with USB charging
The cavernous underseat storage compartment is roomy enough for a full-face helmet and features two helmet hangers. The front storage compartment is equipped with an electric USB socket for conveniently charging your device on the go.
Secure and Convenient
The Zuma 125 provides both a centerstand and side stand for parking convenience. For extra security when parked, the main switch is equipped with a keyhole lock cover. And the fuel filler is found just left of the ignition switch for easy refueling.

2023 Yamaha Tenere 700
THE NEXT HORIZON IS YOURS
A lightweight, no compromise adventure bike with outstanding reliability opens up a new world of possibilities.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The Tenere 700 features a fuel-injected, 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin-cylinder engine derived from Yamaha's award-winning MT-07. This compact powerplant features an ideal power delivery for adventure riding, for tractable and controllable power in every riding condition.
Adventure-Focused Ergonomics
The Tenere 700 features a narrow body, slim fuel tank, and flat seat allowing maximum agility, enabling the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence on dirt or asphalt. The protective fairing and handguards work with the tapered handlebar to ensure comfort on the longest rides.
ENGINE
Compact, High-Tech Engine
Developed from the stellar MT-07 Hyper Naked sportbike, the Tenere 700 engine combines exceptional reliability and exciting power delivery in a compact, fuel-efficient package. With an overall size similar to some single-cylinder motors, the 689cc fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, DOHC inline twin gives the Tenere 700 a slim feel for exceptional off-road confidence, while the counterbalanced two-cylinder design provides smooth, long-legged power ideal for long days in the saddle.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank which traces its lineage directly to the Dakar-dominating XTZ750 race bikes to provide linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. The CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact, and offers an excellent level of rider/machine communication.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Lightweight Double Cradle Frame Design
A lightweight, high-strength tubular steel frame provides a tuned rigidity balance for nimble, responsive handling with the strength and durability needed to tackle the harshest terrain with confidence. The chassis utilizes a short 62.6-inch wheelbase for agility and boasts 9.5 inches of ground clearance to tackle whatever the trail throws at you.
Balanced Ergonomics
The ability to shift body weight forward and rearward to suit the terrain is crucial in off-road riding situations, so the Tenere 700 features a flat seat and slim body that allows maximum rider agility. The narrow body and fuel tank also enable the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence whether you're riding on dirt or asphalt.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Rally-Bred LED Lighting
Echoing the focused, purposeful design of rally-built works racing machines, the Tenere 700 utilizes a clear headlight nacelle with quad LED headlights. This vertically-stacked two-plus-two headlight design provides aggressive looks and excellent visibility, while the LEDs themselves are bright, long-lasting and resistant to shock and vibration.
Protective, Versatile Cockpit
The rally-inspired upper fairing and standard handguards ensure wind and weather protection ideal for long riding days. The taper aluminum handlebar is positioned for a relaxed riding position when sitting or standing on the pegs. The cockpit is also designed to accommodate additional navigation devices, such as a GPS or rally road book.

2023 Yamaha Bolt R-Spec
BORN WITH PERFORMANCE
Featuring a torquey V-Twin engine, this performance bobber combines old-school soul and modern form.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Urban Performance Styling
The Bolt R-Spec is stripped down with minimal chrome, epitomizing the Urban Performance Bobber look. The compact chassis proudly showcases the 58-cubic-inch (942cc) air-cooled 60-degree V-twin powerplant.
Rider-Focused Engine
The Bolt R-Spec uses Yamaha's advanced technology to create a riding experience superior to other similarly sized machines. Fuel injection and ignition timing maps have been chosen specifically for this bike to deliver class-leading performance with strong low- and mid-range torque that's sure to bring a smile to every rider's face.
Compact, Stable Chassis
The slim body and low seat design combine to give the Bolt R-Spec light maneuverability and a stable handling feel. The upright riding posture helps the rider feel the wind, hear the sounds and experience the pulse of the machine.
ENGINE
Air-Cooled V-Twin
The 58-cubic-inch (942cc) engine is an air-cooled SOHC 60-degree V-twin with four valves per cylinder, a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber and 9.0:1 compression ratio. The engine is designed to provide excellent power and superior low-end torque.
Low Friction Internals
Special roller-type rocker arms with needle bearings are used to keep friction loss to a minimum, increase durability and help the engine achieve the ideal performance characteristics.
Advanced Cylinder Design
The pent-roof combustion chamber shape was precisely engineered to direct the fuel/air charge to the center of the piston for more efficient combustion and maximum power. Ceramic-composite plated cylinders provide excellent heat dissipation and reduced oil consumption.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Handling-Focused Frame
A double-cradle frame provides precise handling and enhances city riding enjoyment thanks to the rigid mount system mounting the engine directly to the frame.
Low Seat Height
The low-set seat provides a great riding position while being a mere 27.2 inches off the pavement, so most riders can easily put both feet firmly on the ground at a stop.
Agile Wheelbase
Bolt R-Spec's short, 61.8-inch wheelbase contributes to the bike's great handling, providing precise, tight turns in city riding and solid, stable handling on the open road.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Modern Lighting
LED rear taillight looks cool and adds to the modern bobber appeal.
Slick Instruments
Compact digital LCD meter assembly provides clean styling with excellent visibility.
Real Steel Fenders
Steel front and rear fenders are ideal for personalization, including paint and customization.
Bobber-Style Seat
Solo rider saddle adds to the minimalist bobber look while providing support for longer rides.

2018 Vulcan Sell or Trade For Corolla,https://klamath.craigslist.org/mcy/d/klamath-falls-2018-vulcan-sell-or-trade/7583072029.html,7583072029.0,"02/02/2023, 15:33:09","$6,000","2018 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic LT, only 6580 miles, USB phone charger. This is the deluxe model with a passenger back rest, saddlebags, and an adjustable windshield. It is registered until 5/24 and I have the Oregon title in my name. Two trunk boxes with keys (not installed) plus a rear chrome luggage rack (not installed) are included. $6,000 or offer.

I might consider trading the Vulcan plus some cash for a Toyota Corolla 4 Door Sedan. The Toyota Corolla would need to be currently registered and the title would need to be in your name. No Rebuilt or Salvage titles. It would need to have air conditioning, automatic transmission, and cruze control. Any color except for Black. Black cars are simply too hot for me in the summer. I’m probably looking for 125,000 miles or less with a value of roughly $8,000 or less.

I purchased the Vulcan for one last big camping adventure from Klamath Falls to Montana before ending up in a wheelchair. I planned to attach the trunk boxes (one on the passenger seat and one in the rear so that I could take along some cooking gear and clothes. (tent, pad, and sleeping bag would fit in the saddle bags) Once the weather warmed up this next summer, I thought that I would leave. My legs have since become worse and now the motorcycle is no longer such a great idea. I was thinking why waste such a great last adventure, why not take a car instead and use the cruze control should my legs give out. If you have a Corolla or wish to purchase the Vulcan, send me your thoughts.

Another thought might be that someone has a Toyota Corolla that is about to go into re-possession. Perhaps I could pay off the the loan on the right car for a thousand or two. The person would then have my Vulcan to keep plus not defaulting and getting bad credit. In turn, I would get the Toyota Corolla that I require for my last adventure. It could possibly be a win - win for both of us.",gas,6580.0,manual,,excellent,clean,900.0,,yes,cruiser,,,,,

2022 Yamaha MT-07
DARK ATTRACTION
Featuring a distinctive next generation look and features, as well as an advanced twin-cylinder engine. Experience the best balance of performance and value the Dark Side has to offer.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The MT-07 features an updated, compact 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin cylinder, DOHC engine with fuel injection. The unique power character of the engine provides outstanding low- to mid-range torque with a linear throttle response and strong high-rpm pulling power. Maximizing riding excitement in the real world, the engine maintains the same level of response due to its intake air duct design, exhaust system specs - now integrated 2-into-1 exhaust pipes and muffler - and updated ECU specs. The fuel injection settings were also optimized to bring refinements to the engine's linear response characteristics while the throttle is slightly open at low rpm. Other updates include new valve seats with excellent abrasion resistance for the exhaust side, improved gearshift feel thanks to different cut angles for the dog gears, and repositioning for the catalytic converter - now closer to the headers - and oxygen sensor.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank that provides linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. Offering excellent rider-machine communication, the CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Assertive Riding Position
To alleviate any sense of narrowness, the MT-07 features a new tapered handlebar that is 32mm wider and 19mm taller and offers improved feelings of control and comfort for a wider range of rider sizes.
Compact Frame Design
The high-strength steel frame provides an optimized balance of rigidity for nimble, agile handling. As a stressed member of the chassis, the engine allows for a lighter, more compact main frame design, contributing to a low wet weight of only 406 lb.
ADDITIONAL
New LCD Meter
The MT-07 features a new multifunction negative-display LCD dash with a black background and white readouts while RPMS of 10k - 12k are indicated with a red color. Designed specifically for the MT-07's cockpit, the arrangement of the information features a larger display for the clock, current gear, trip/odometers and tachometer. Trip 1, Trip 2 and Trip F, the temperature and other meter functions can be toggled and reset with the left handlebar thumb switch while key displays like the gear indicator are on the right while the tachometer are positioned along the top.
Next-Generation Design
Joining the 3rd generation MT style - as featured on the MT-09 - the MT-07's new look further brings out its distinctive appeal with fashion-leading colors and graphics. The newly designed parts and components are integrated with minimal structural elements, creating an attractive design that emphasizes pure Hyper Naked character. With a silhouette that is synonymous with the MT Series' signature statement of torque and power, the MT-07 showcases a tight, compact and powerful appearance.

2022 Yamaha YZ450FX
POWER, TUNED TO PERFECTION
Whether cutting through tight technical trails or blazing across the wide open desert, the class-defining YZ450FX takes off-road performance to new levels.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
The YZ450FX's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted down-draft intake system features a cylinder head that works with the frame geometry for optimized weight distribution. Internally, the engine features a straight intake tract, aggressive cam profiles, a high-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin and more. Finally, the YZ450FX features specific ECU settings to suit the needs of cross country riders.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Engine Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing riding conditions. Map 1 provides more responsive, quicker revving engine characteristics while Map 2 provides smoother response, slower revving characteristics for when traction is limited.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
The upper frame bracing provides rigidity and durability while rear frame spars and cross country-tuned engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of impact absorption, stiffness and rider feeling.
Class-Leading Suspension
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension uses a KYB shock with specially-tuned damping characteristics to match the YZ450FX chassis with both front and rear system settings for optimal GNCC performance.
270mm Front Brake
Large 270mm front rotor coupled with aggressive pad material offer excellent braking performance and feel with exceptional stopping power and controllability.
ADDITIONAL
GNCC-Focused Details
The YZ450FX includes a range of cross country specific upgrades compared to the YZ450F motocrosser including a composite engine guard, 18-inch rear wheel, sealed O-ring chain, fuel level warning indicator and a folding aluminum kickstand.
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
Four-position adjustable handlebar clamps are rubber mounted to improve comfort, reduce handlebar vibration and allow riders to adjust the bar position, while the oversize 1-1/8-inch handlebar is strong but lightweight.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

2022 Yamaha YZ65
MOTOCROSS DREAMS START HERE
Designed for the discriminating mini-moto racer with dreams of victory. The YZ65 is the perfect first step into the victory zone.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Potent Two-Stroke Engine
The 65cc two-stroke powerplant features the same advanced technologies found in Yamaha's race-winning YZ125 and YZ250 motocrossers.
Race-Developed Intake
With a carefully tuned Hitachi Astemo Keihin PWK28 carburetor to meter fuel flow, the proven reed-valve induction improves acceleration and throttle response across the entire powerband.
Yamaha Power Valve System
Patented YPVS combines crisp bottom-end torque with potent mid-range and free-revving top-end, making the most of the compact engine and lightweight chassis.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Compact Steel Frame
The YZ65 offers light, neutral handling built on a strong steel cradle frame. Designed around the rigidity balance required for the 65cc class, this frame delivers excellent bump absorption in the roughest track sections, jump landings and whoop sections.
Lightweight Subframe
Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight and convenient maintenance, just like the full-size motocross bikes.
Adjustable Suspension Systems
Up front, a 36mm KYB coil spring fork offers excellent compliance with settings based on Yamaha's extensive testing experience. Out back, a link-less shock design is light and compact and works through a swingarm with YZ125-style chain adjusters. Both front and rear suspension systems are tunable for both rebound and compression damping.
ADDITIONAL
Adjustable Ergonomics
With a four-position adjustable aluminum handlebar clamp, adjustable position clutch and front brake levers, grippy foot pegs and long seat design to help riders move across the bike, the YZ65 is highly tunable to fit riders of various sizes.
Aggressive YZ Family Styling
The YZ65 may be the smallest member of the family, but it packs in the same aggressive styling as the larger YZ and YZ-F siblings. Even down to the slick blue Excel wheels.

2-STROKES. 1 GOAL.
Engineered with all the reliability and durability you've come to expect from Yamaha, this 2-stroke was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
ENGINE
GNCC-Tuned YZ250 Power
Based on the legendary YZ250 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine, the YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, exhaust port timing, revised Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) timing and a model-specific CDI unit all focused on creating a wide, controllable power character ideal for cross country racing.
Revised Power Valve
The YZ250X features the patented Yamaha Power Valve System with broader opening timing compared to the YZ250 for smoother power to combine bottom-end acceleration with strong mid-range and top-end.
Narrow Exhaust Pipe
Unique compact exhaust expansion chamber is designed especially for the YZ250X to improve both horizontal and vertical clearance on tight, technical trails while still providing excellent exhaust efficiency.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Industry-Leading KYB Fork
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB spring-type fork with speed-sensitive damping uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling and a smooth ride. With minimal wasted stroke or abrupt shocks for the rider, this bike is tuned for the demands of cross country racing.
Smooth KYB Shock
Fully adjustable KYB rear shock features 12.4 inches of travel, separate adjusters for high- and low-speed compression damping and a full lock oil rebound system for increased comfort, control and fantastic rear wheel traction in challenging conditions.
YZ250-Based Frame
A carefully engineered aluminum frame and swingarm give the YZ250X the famous handling proven by the championship-winning YZ motocross riders on tracks around the world.
ADDITIONAL
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.

2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.
Features may include:ENGINE
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

SUPER CLEAN BIKE, LOTS OF EXTRAS!
2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8 aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

2009 Kawasaki KLR 650,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcy/d/phoenix-2009-kawasaki-klr-650/7584687418.html,7584687418.0,"02/02/2023, 15:33:56","$4,200","2009 KLR 650. Great shape, stored indoors. Aftermarket hand and frame guards. Recent oil change, tires are good, new battery kept on a tender. It's only run ethanol-free gas since new, so no gunk in the carburetor. Runs perfectly, I wouldn't hesitate to take this around the world.

The question is, do you wanna ride around the world, slowly and reliably, sticking to highways and gravel roads on something that weighs more than your parents combined? Zero technological advancements have been implemented since the KLR's inception in 1986 so you can easily scavenge parts from one that's broken down, oh wait, they don't break down! So the ability to retro-fit everything is unneeded. The doo-hickey mod was done by the previous owner. I still don't know what that is, but apparently it's important because it's listed in literally every KLR ad. Sticker on the side of the case to prove it.

As long as your definition of after-market support is a milk-crate and zip ties, then you're in luck. There's even a KLR aisle at Harbor Freight.

Fuel injection! Yeah right, that was only implemented after Russian invaded Ukraine (unrelated). The only time Kawasaki did away with the carburetor on this mechanical marvel was with the release of a diesel spec'd for the US military. You'll be able to feel the thump from this large single cylinder, which somehow manages to make less horsepower than engines with half the displacement. More torque though. A lot more. One person even got the front wheel off the ground one time! I heard he lives in Alabama.

This 'dull swiss-army knife' of bikes can do anything a motorcycle can do, albeit poorly. If you want one bike, buy a GS-650. Unless you're on a budget, then this bike is perfect. It's actually an investment since they don't depreciate. The second generations are actually going up in value, with how the stockmarket is performing, KLR's should be your new retirement plan.

Move over KTM540 and hello KLR 501K.




Comes with a rack and hard-sided, waterproof lockable boxes. Makes it easy to run errands or strap on enough luggage on for an epic overland trip.

It has lowering links on it right now, so the stand over heights is about 2"" lower than stock, making it perfect for a shorter rider or a new rider. Once you get more comfortable, you can put the regular links (included) on to bring it back to stock height.

It's a change that is immediately apparent at the first crack of the throttle and throughout the entire rpm range.

Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.

NEW FOR 2023
Powerful New 125cc Two-Stroke Engine
A completely redesigned liquid-cooled 125cc two-stroke engine boasts improved usability and increased mid- and top-end power over the 2022 model for a thrilling new level of performance.
Improved Fueling

2023 Yamaha Bolt R-Spec
BORN WITH PERFORMANCE
Featuring a torquey V-Twin engine, this performance bobber combines old-school soul and modern form.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Urban Performance Styling
The Bolt R-Spec is stripped down with minimal chrome, epitomizing the Urban Performance Bobber look. The compact chassis proudly showcases the 58-cubic-inch (942cc) air-cooled 60-degree V-twin powerplant.
Rider-Focused Engine
The Bolt R-Spec uses Yamaha's advanced technology to create a riding experience superior to other similarly sized machines. Fuel injection and ignition timing maps have been chosen specifically for this bike to deliver class-leading performance with strong low- and mid-range torque that's sure to bring a smile to every rider's face.
Compact, Stable Chassis
The slim body and low seat design combine to give the Bolt R-Spec light maneuverability and a stable handling feel. The upright riding posture helps the rider feel the wind, hear the sounds and experience the pulse of the machine.
ENGINE
Air-Cooled V-Twin
The 58-cubic-inch (942cc) engine is an air-cooled SOHC 60-degree V-twin with four valves per cylinder, a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber and 9.0:1 compression ratio. The engine is designed to provide excellent power and superior low-end torque.
Low Friction Internals
Special roller-type rocker arms with needle bearings are used to keep friction loss to a minimum, increase durability and help the engine achieve the ideal performance characteristics.
Advanced Cylinder Design
The pent-roof combustion chamber shape was precisely engineered to direct the fuel/air charge to the center of the piston for more efficient combustion and maximum power. Ceramic-composite plated cylinders provide excellent heat dissipation and reduced oil consumption.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Handling-Focused Frame
A double-cradle frame provides precise handling and enhances city riding enjoyment thanks to the rigid mount system mounting the engine directly to the frame.
Low Seat Height
The low-set seat provides a great riding position while being a mere 27.2 inches off the pavement, so most riders can easily put both feet firmly on the ground at a stop.
Agile Wheelbase
Bolt R-Spec's short, 61.8-inch wheelbase contributes to the bike's great handling, providing precise, tight turns in city riding and solid, stable handling on the open road.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Modern Lighting
LED rear taillight looks cool and adds to the modern bobber appeal.
Slick Instruments
Compact digital LCD meter assembly provides clean styling with excellent visibility.
Real Steel Fenders
Steel front and rear fenders are ideal for personalization, including paint and customization.
Bobber-Style Seat
Solo rider saddle adds to the minimalist bobber look while providing support for longer rides.

THE DARK BECKONS
Your entry to the Dark Side. Built to thrill with a twin-cylinder engine, aggressive looks and serious street presence.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Smooth & Easy To Ride Power Delivery
This 321cc liquid-cooled two-cylinder engine features lightweight forged pistons and carburized connecting rods, delivering easy to manage power in the low rpm range with strong high rpm power. The extremely light clutch feeling makes the MT-03 even more fun in the city, while its offset cylinders and advanced fuel injection system ensures smooth throttle response.
Dual Position Lights with Singular LED Headlight
The dynamic MT-03 looks cool with its dual angled position lights that emphasize its aggressive big-bike looks. A single compact and powerful LED headlight burns a hole through the darkness to light up the road ahead.
ENGINE
Potent Twin-Cylinder Powerplant
Yamaha's 321cc liquid-cooled, inline two-cylinder engine delivers excellent power and performance throughout the rpm range. With a 180-degree crank design and integrated counterbalancer, the layout minimizes vibrations for a smooth, refined engine character.
Smooth & Useable Power
With double overhead cams (DOHC) and four-valve cylinder heads, the MT-03 engine provides easy-to-manage power at low rpms with strong rpm power ultimately delivering an exciting ride with a broad spread of power.
Six-Speed Transmission
A smooth-shifting six-speed gearbox ensures the rider always has the right ratio, whether riding through tight city streets or on the open highway.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Inverted KYB Front Fork
The MT-03 features an inverted KYB fork with optimized spring and damping settings, delivering more solid handling when compared to motorcycles using conventional front forks.
Monocross Rear Shock
The seven-step preload adjustable single-shock design is tuned to strike a balance between ride comfort and sporty performance with capability across a wide range of uses, from urban commuting to extended rides into the twisty canyons.
Long Swingarm
The MT-03 is equipped with a 22.6-inch long asymmetrical swingarm that provides a planted ride during braking, cornering and acceleration.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Stylish LED Turn Signals
Light-Emitting Diode (LED) elements are used for both the front and rear turn signals. Not only do LEDs offer long life with minimal power draw, they provide brilliant illumination for confidence and visibility, during the day or night. The MT-03's dynamic appearance is reinforced by the LED signals that perfectly complement the bike's aggressive looks.
Dynamic Mass Forward Design
Yamaha's Hyper Naked bikes are instantly recognizable thanks to their aggressive and powerful design. A sculpted fuel tank cover is designed to fit snugly with the rider while the lightweight air scoops enhance the look and feel of the mass-forward body design and highlight the dynamic MT family look.
Ergonomic Riding Position
With its compact body and low 30.7-inch seat height, the MT-03 is a joy to ride whether you're escaping traffic or having a blast out on the open road. Behind the aggressive bodywork, a specially sculpted knee area and fuel tank cover work with the high-mounted handlebars to provide an agile and ergonomic riding position.

2023 Yamaha YZ250X
TWO-STROKE HEART, ENDURO SOUL
Featuring a powerful 250cc two-stroke engine and renowned high performance chassis, the YZ250X was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Two-Stroke Power: Tuned for Enduro Racing
The YZ250X is optimized for the unique demands of Hare Scrambles and GNCC racing. The Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS)-equipped 249cc two-stroke engine is mated to a wide-ratio five-speed transmission for the ultimate cross country power plant.
Advanced Motocross-Derived Chassis
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. The industry-leading fully adjustable Speed Sensitive System KYB spring-type front fork is matched with a fully adjustable high performance KYB long-travel rear shock, both tested and tuned specifically for the needs of cross country racers.
ENGINE
Exhilarating Two-Stroke Power
The 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine is lightweight, compact and fun, with an incredibly wide, hard-hitting powerband.
Tuned for GNCC Competition
The YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, revised YPVS timing and a model-specific digital CDI unit compared to its motocross sibling all focused on creating a broad, usable power delivery specifically suited to cross country and enduro-style competition.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
YZ250-Based Frame
Ultra-lightweight YZ250-spec frame features carefully engineered combination of aluminum castings, forgings and extrusions for the perfect balance of rigidity and flex. Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight.
Industry-Leading KYB Fork
The fully adjustable KYB 48mm forks feature the Speed-Sensitive System which uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling, superb bump absorption and 11.8 inches of suspension travel. Additionally, a newly adopted scraper between the dust and oil seal improves reliability in cross country conditions.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.
Cross Country Features
The YZ250X is focused on cross country competition with an 18-inch rear wheel, wide-ratio gearing, standard side stand, sealed O-ring chain, reserve fuel petcock, and newly adopted scraper between the fork's dust and oil seal, all adding up to exceptional cross country performance.
NEW FOR 2023
Improved Rider Ergonomics
To increase rider confidence in challenging cross country conditions, new smoothly integrated body panels, more narrow fuel tank design, slimmer shroud width and flatter seat all combine to enable greater freedom of movement forward and back, allowing the rider to easily shift body weight for better control.
Bold New YZ Styling
Along with the slimmer, more aggressive bodywork, a new front and rear fender design and new radiator shrouds all integrate with a bold new graphics scheme to highlight the YZ family pedigree. Premium Yamaha graphics are now embedded to provide excellent durability and scratch resistance.

2023 Yamaha Tenere 700
THE NEXT HORIZON IS YOURS
A lightweight, no compromise adventure bike with outstanding reliability opens up a new world of possibilities.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The Tenere 700 features a fuel-injected, 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin-cylinder engine derived from Yamaha's award-winning MT-07. This compact powerplant features an ideal power delivery for adventure riding, for tractable and controllable power in every riding condition.
Adventure-Focused Ergonomics
The Tenere 700 features a narrow body, slim fuel tank, and flat seat allowing maximum agility, enabling the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence on dirt or asphalt. The protective fairing and handguards work with the tapered handlebar to ensure comfort on the longest rides.
ENGINE
Compact, High-Tech Engine
Developed from the stellar MT-07 Hyper Naked sportbike, the Tenere 700 engine combines exceptional reliability and exciting power delivery in a compact, fuel-efficient package. With an overall size similar to some single-cylinder motors, the 689cc fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, DOHC inline twin gives the Tenere 700 a slim feel for exceptional off-road confidence, while the counterbalanced two-cylinder design provides smooth, long-legged power ideal for long days in the saddle.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank which traces its lineage directly to the Dakar-dominating XTZ750 race bikes to provide linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. The CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact, and offers an excellent level of rider/machine communication.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Lightweight Double Cradle Frame Design
A lightweight, high-strength tubular steel frame provides a tuned rigidity balance for nimble, responsive handling with the strength and durability needed to tackle the harshest terrain with confidence. The chassis utilizes a short 62.6-inch wheelbase for agility and boasts 9.5 inches of ground clearance to tackle whatever the trail throws at you.
Balanced Ergonomics
The ability to shift body weight forward and rearward to suit the terrain is crucial in off-road riding situations, so the Tenere 700 features a flat seat and slim body that allows maximum rider agility. The narrow body and fuel tank also enable the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence whether you're riding on dirt or asphalt.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Rally-Bred LED Lighting
Echoing the focused, purposeful design of rally-built works racing machines, the Tenere 700 utilizes a clear headlight nacelle with quad LED headlights. This vertically-stacked two-plus-two headlight design provides aggressive looks and excellent visibility, while the LEDs themselves are bright, long-lasting and resistant to shock and vibration.
Protective, Versatile Cockpit
The rally-inspired upper fairing and standard handguards ensure wind and weather protection ideal for long riding days. The taper aluminum handlebar is positioned for a relaxed riding position when sitting or standing on the pegs. The cockpit is also designed to accommodate additional navigation devices, such as a GPS or rally road book.

The all-new YZF-R7 boasts a 270-degree crankshaft that delivers a tactile experience of pulse and acceleration with limited vibration. The CP2 engine provides the rider a linear-feeling, direct connection from the throttle to the rear wheel.
All-New A&S Clutch
A first for Yamaha's CP2 platform, the all-new Assist and Slipper clutch reduces clutch lever force while providing seamless downshifts and a controlled feeling over the bike's engine braking. This helps make the supersport riding experience more accessible to more riders. For fast and smooth upshifts, an optional Quick Shift System (QSS) is also available on the YZF-R7.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Supersport Riding Position
The YZF-R7's carefully developed rider's triangle and racing-inspired cockpit puts you in a comfortable, confidence-inspiring riding position. A new seat combined with new tank covers featuring deep knee pockets, provide optimal hip and knee positioning. Riders get the freedom to adjust positions while also maintaining a firmly planted feel in corners and sturdy body hold under braking. Separate clip-on handlebars are set in relation to rider hip and footpeg placement for a commanding riding position.
Inverted Front Fork
The YZF-R7 features a preload, rebound and compression adjustable inverted KYB 41mm front fork offering optimized spring rates and damping settings for an excellent front-end feel during cornering and braking.
Lightweight Frame Tuned for Rigidity Balance
A high-strength steel frame with a rigid-mount aluminum center brace provides an optimized balance of rigidity for linear and nimble responsiveness to rider input.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Adaptive Bi-Functional LED Headlight
The iconic R-Series M-shaped intake duct and twin-eye look compliments the all-new YZF-R7 along with an adaptive bi-functional LED headlight.
ELECTRONICS
Digital LCD Instrumentation
A new full-LCD instrument panel informs the rider of gear position, fuel capacity, real time and average fuel economy, water temp, clock, and more all presented in a high-contrast display.

First year production!

The bike had only Two Owners!

Currently it has just over 41k miles.

Always garaged!

It has not been ridden since 2010 but the Previous Summer I took it in for a tune up and had carburetors rebuilt, fresh fluids, new timing belt, new battery, and for a general look over.

I was thinking to turn it into a Cafe Racer style bike but it's too nice for that so I had it just parked and garaged after the tune up.

It has the fairings, radio, cargo rack, comfy seats with backrest, trailer hitch and more...
Original service manual and repair book is included.

I'm posting the ad now to see if there's any interest in the motorcycle and I'll be bring it our of storage once the weather gets better.

2023 Yamaha YZF-R3
R WORLD IS CALLING
Legendary Yamaha superbike styling, advanced twin cylinder engine and ultra-light chassis the perfect entry into R World.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Sleek R-Series Styling
Featuring flowing bodywork and ergonomics inspired by the MotoGP YZR-M1, complemented by new colors and graphics, the YZF-R3 is sleek, aerodynamic and refined.
High-Revving Supersport Engine
Yamaha's championship-winning technology gives the YZF-R3 a broad spread of power with exciting high-rpm performance.
Advanced Suspension
The R3's inverted fork works with a Monocross rear shock to provide exceptional handling, with balanced chassis rigidity, a near 50/50 weight balance, and damping and spring settings designed for a wide range of road conditions.
ENGINE
Potent Twin-Cylinder Powerplant
Yamaha's 321cc liquid-cooled, inline 2-cylinder engine delivers excellent power and performance throughout the rpm range. With a 180-degree crank design and integrated counterbalancer, the layout minimizes vibrations for a smooth, refined engine character.
High-Revving Engine Architecture
With a compression ratio of 11.2:1, double overhead cams (DOHC) and four-valve cylinder heads, the YZF-R3 motor is designed for quick-revving performance and high-rpm efficiency to deliver an exciting ride with a broad spread of power.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Inverted Front Fork
The YZF-R3 features an inverted fork with optimized spring and damping settings, significantly improving fork rigidity, front-end feedback and control. The design also includes a YZR-M1-inspired top clamp for improved supersport style.
Monocross Rear Shock
The single-shock design further centralizes mass and is tuned to strike a balance between ride comfort and sporty performance, for capability across a wide range of uses, from urban commuting to track days. It's also adjustable for spring preload which accounts for passengers or cargo.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Sleek R-Series Styling
The R3's aggressive design continues the legendary styling born from the YZR-M1 MotoGP machine and improves overall aerodynamics at high speeds too. The glaring face of the R3 features compact LED headlights with a central air duct that maximizes cooling airflow for the engine.
LED Lighting
Light Emitted Diode (LED) elements are used for both the taillight unit and headlights. Not only do LEDs offer long life with minimal power draw, they provide brilliant illumination for confidence and visibility day or night.

2022 Yamaha MT-07
DARK ATTRACTION
Featuring a distinctive next generation look and features, as well as an advanced twin-cylinder engine. Experience the best balance of performance and value the Dark Side has to offer.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The MT-07 features an updated, compact 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin cylinder, DOHC engine with fuel injection. The unique power character of the engine provides outstanding low- to mid-range torque with a linear throttle response and strong high-rpm pulling power. Maximizing riding excitement in the real world, the engine maintains the same level of response due to its intake air duct design, exhaust system specs - now integrated 2-into-1 exhaust pipes and muffler - and updated ECU specs. The fuel injection settings were also optimized to bring refinements to the engine's linear response characteristics while the throttle is slightly open at low rpm. Other updates include new valve seats with excellent abrasion resistance for the exhaust side, improved gearshift feel thanks to different cut angles for the dog gears, and repositioning for the catalytic converter - now closer to the headers - and oxygen sensor.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank that provides linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. Offering excellent rider-machine communication, the CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Assertive Riding Position
To alleviate any sense of narrowness, the MT-07 features a new tapered handlebar that is 32mm wider and 19mm taller and offers improved feelings of control and comfort for a wider range of rider sizes.
Compact Frame Design
The high-strength steel frame provides an optimized balance of rigidity for nimble, agile handling. As a stressed member of the chassis, the engine allows for a lighter, more compact main frame design, contributing to a low wet weight of only 406 lb.
ADDITIONAL
New LCD Meter
The MT-07 features a new multifunction negative-display LCD dash with a black background and white readouts while RPMS of 10k - 12k are indicated with a red color. Designed specifically for the MT-07's cockpit, the arrangement of the information features a larger display for the clock, current gear, trip/odometers and tachometer. Trip 1, Trip 2 and Trip F, the temperature and other meter functions can be toggled and reset with the left handlebar thumb switch while key displays like the gear indicator are on the right while the tachometer are positioned along the top.
Next-Generation Design
Joining the 3rd generation MT style - as featured on the MT-09 - the MT-07's new look further brings out its distinctive appeal with fashion-leading colors and graphics. The newly designed parts and components are integrated with minimal structural elements, creating an attractive design that emphasizes pure Hyper Naked character. With a silhouette that is synonymous with the MT Series' signature statement of torque and power, the MT-07 showcases a tight, compact and powerful appearance.

ENGINE
Powerful 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The MT-09 features the renowned 890cc liquid-cooled CP3 engine. Bore and stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and an 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with thrilling power delivery characteristics. The combination of exceptional combustion efficiency and light weight results in an impressive 49 MPG.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Lightweight Aluminum Frame
The MT-09 features an advanced, lightweight aluminum frame refined to showcase the MT's signature agility. To ensure both straight-line stability and handling performance, the balance of longitudinal, lateral and torsional rigidity are all carefully considered and finely tuned. The frame is manufactured using the latest in Yamaha's controlled filling (CF) die casting technology which contributes to the MT-09 being one of the lightest bikes in its class at just 417 pounds.
Aluminum Die Cast Subframe
The MT-09 also employs a controlled filling aluminum die-cast subframe that reduces weight and further contributes to the model's signature feeling of agility.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Next-Generation Design
With the MT-09 designers sought to better express the major advances made with the machine's performance by visually accentuating the pure power of the bike. The minimalist design concept delivers an exterior with everything but the essentials stripped away to highlight lightness and agility while stimulating the rider's senses.
ELECTRONICS
Advanced Six-Axis IMU
The MT-09 features an advanced six-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that retains the base performance of proven IMU in the YZF-R1 but is 50% smaller and 40% lighter due to a thorough review of the sensor layout. The engine control unit (ECU) that receives and reflects the data from the IMU is equipped with three rider aids: a Traction Control System (TCS), Slide Control System (SCS) and front-wheel LIFt control system (LIF). All three systems work together to help the rider concentrate on riding to better extract the machine's potential. Each of the systems can also be turned on or off and have their levels of intervention adjusted to preference. With this best-in-class electronic control technology, the MT-09 gives you the ultimate control in varying weather and surface conditions.
Rider-Supporting Traction Control System
The Traction Control System (TCS) has three modes: Mode 1, Mode 2 and Mode M for manual settings. Each mode integrates the three rider support systems by changing the degree of intervention for the TCS, SCS and LIF all at once. With Mode M, the user can select his/her preferred levels of intervention for the TCS, SCS and LIF individually.

2001 Aprilia Falco,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2001-aprilia-falco/7582228857.html,7582228857.0,"02/02/2023, 15:35:36","$2,465","The buyer, now seller of this 2001 Aprilia Falco called the shop on a rainy day in January of 2010, made a deal, gave his address in Alaska and said he would be there in the morning. Did I mention it was raining cats and dogs that week?

You could call me Mister Blue if you thought I believed he was serious, you know, holding my breath and sitting in the corner waiting for him to turn up.
But he did with all his gear after an all night flight to Medford. Never underestimate the love of riding a motorcycle!

We finished the sale and watched him ride into the rain on a Tuesday. A week later he returned looking like a drown rat, but he had a huge grin on his mug. Twelve years on, Bill has flown down about twice a year to ride his bike, covering more roads in Oregon, California and Washington than anyone I know has.

Time goes on and the time has arrived to sell his bike. It now has 22,473 miles on it, 12,000 more than when he picked up in 2010. Along the way it has gained a couple of travel scars, one of which I am responsible for. Bill came down one spring for a ride and we both noticed his tires were worn. I had a set of Dunlap GP track only tires lying around that we installed (which I forgot require tire warmers before use to bring them up to operating temperature). Well, the first cool morning start for Bill lasted to the first corner. The left side got some rash, but it was very slow and the trip was not interrupted. Hansen’s did the minor service work on it, Bill did the oil changes when needed. Tires are now about 50% in the rear, 70% in the front. The battery is new. Bill also wired the radiator thermal switch to one mounted on the fairing. He did not trust the factory setup.

This is my write up from 2010:

“Once in awhile, a bike comes in that is just so beautiful, I know that any pictures I take of it are not going to do it justice. The 2001 Aprilia model of the Falco is the same bike they built through 2004 which for an Aprilia sold in good numbers. This bike comes with the Aprilia Factory Carbon. There are a set of saddle bags that attach to the bike if touring is part of your plan. It is cosmetically perfect, the tires look like they have at least 80% of their thread left and it sounds like only a big displacement twin with pipes can sound, deep and wonderful. Miles are just over 10,000. The bike looks expensive and it is rare in the Southern Oregon. If you are looking for something that is going to stand out amongst the other Japanese bikes around, here is a way to do it for a reasonable cost. The selling price is $5895.”

2013 Harley Davidson Electra Glide FLHTK Tiltlock Front End,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2013-harley-davidson/7582228378.html,7582228378.0,"02/02/2023, 15:35:39","$23,995","This 2013 Harley Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Limited, equipped with it’s Tilting Motor Works Trio with Tiltlock Front End and it’s CVO paint scheme, will most likely turn more heads than any other custom Harley at any gathering of bikes.

Obviously there is a lot to understand about the front end of the bike, but the FLHTK it is mounted to is absolutely beautiful with other amenities that need mentioning to see the entire package. Besides the Trio Front End, a Motor Trike Mechanical Reverse was installed, both less than 500 miles ago. The cost for Reverse unit and installation was over $3,300. The Trio and installation cost, with the custom CVO paint scheme was $17,595. It is expensive to be having this much fun! The bike is fully equipped from Harley including their Travel Pack along with all of these standard FLHTK features:

• Twin Cam 103™ engine with Electronic Sequential Port Fuel Injection (ESTI) with heated O2 sensors and Electronic Throttle
Control (ETC)
• Integrated oil cooler
• 6-speed Cruise Drive® transmission with integrated Isolated Drive System (IDS)
• Dunlop® “Multi-Tread” rear tire construction extends tire life by 25 percent
• Brembo® 4-piston front and rear caliper with dual front rotor brake system
• Air-adjustable rear shocks
• Full-length rider footboards
• Height-adjustable passenger footboards
• Six-gallon fuel tank
• Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
• Harley-Davidson® Smart Security System with hands-free security fob
• Electronic cruise control

Then there is the Motor Trike Reverse and Trio Front End with it’s two Front wheels and tires. The owner of the bike had balancing issues developing the past few years and landed on these options to keep his motorcycle career rolling on, giving him stability when he came to a stop and being able to back the bike up when he physically could not.

First was the Tilting Motor Works Trio Front End which was custom painted in the COV trim. What an eye full of mechanical, custom parts that adds an additional front tire for stability at full stops without detracting from the leaning and turning action of the motorcycle when in motion. I am unable to explain how it all works but I would take up Tilting Motor’s (in Eugene Oregon) offer of free classes to anyone who wants to learn how to use the bike. I did ride it for a short distance and there will be an obvious short learning curve for sure but if felt like a motorcycle when in motion. When coming to a stop, flip the switch on the left handle bar and the comes to center within seconds. WOW!!!

The Motor Trike Reverse gear set up was an obvious choice to a bike with the Trio Front End and the weight of the stock Harley. It is mechanical and easy to operate once you have read the owner’s manual which comes with the bike.

All and all, this motorcycle is the perfect alternative to a Trike which is not completely a motorcycle experience while still providing mechanical assistance with slow speed and stopping maneuvers.

2023 Yamaha Zuma 125
COMPACT RUGGED ADVENTURER
The reimagined, ultra-modern, Zuma 125 is a rugged and fuel efficient scooter with big features in a compact package.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Blue Core VVA Engine
Powering the Zuma 125 is a compact Yamaha Blue Core, VVA (Variable Valve Actuation) 125cc 4-stroke engine with 4 valves, a 11.2:1 compression ratio, DiASil cylinder and aluminum alloy forged piston, giving this scooter modern reliability and economical performance. With an amazing 101 mpg and a 1.6 gallon fuel tank, you get plenty of range, too.
Automatic Convenience
A fully-automatic V-belt transmission and push-button electric starting make the Zuma 125 a super-convenient transportation option. Standard center and side stands, along with a locking cover on the ignition switch, make it easy and secure to park, too.
ENGINE
Automatic Convenience
Fully automatic, V-belt transmission with centrifugal clutch provides easy, twist-the-throttle-and-go operation with great off-the-line acceleration.
Clean-Running Design
An upswept muffler incorporates two exhaust catalysts to reduce air pollution and meet emission regulations.
Comfort-Focused Engine Bracket
A reliable steel engine bracket with rubber bushing linkage contributes a comfortable ride with reduced vibration. The link mechanisms are positioned on the underside of the chassis to maximize space for the storage compartment.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Comfortable Ergonomics
A plush and roomy riding position is ready for two, with a narrow seat design for easier flat-footing at stops, and plenty of leg space in front of the rider's seat. Meanwhile, the passenger gets dedicated foldable footrests and secure handholds that blend cleanly into the Zuma 125's body design.
Durable Suspension
The telescopic fork features beefy outer tubes for strength, while fork boots help protect the large 33mm inner tubes from debris. The rear wheel swingarm features twin rear shocks with a full 3.1 in of travel for comfortable riding both on streets and on unpaved roads.
Extensive Fuel Range
The Zuma 125 boasts extreme fuel efficiency carrying the 1.6 gallon fuel tank over a wide cruising range. Its fuel tank emissions system includes a charcoal canister to control gasoline evaporation and reduce air pollution.
Hardy Steel Frame
The robust steel-tube frame is light but strong, and features a step-through design for easy mounting.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Modern Gauge Package
The Zuma 125's stylish LCD meter features a fuel gauge as well as a full range of indicator lights with easy-to-read visibility.
Plenty of Storage with USB charging
The cavernous underseat storage compartment is roomy enough for a full-face helmet and features two helmet hangers. The front storage compartment is equipped with an electric USB socket for conveniently charging your device on the go.
Secure and Convenient
The Zuma 125 provides both a centerstand and side stand for parking convenience. For extra security when parked, the main switch is equipped with a keyhole lock cover. And the fuel filler is found just left of the ignition switch for easy refueling.

2023 Yamaha XT250
GO ANYWHERE DUAL SPORT
With electric start and a low seat height, the light, nimble and reliable XT250 is built to go wherever you go. On- or off-road.
Features may include:
Advanced Long-Travel Suspension
Long-travel suspension with more than 11.2 inches of ground clearance live under a seat that's only 31.9 inches from the ground.
Modern Fuel Injection
The XT250's fuel injection offers smooth throttle response and easy starting in a range of conditions.
Convenient Electric Start
Electric start makes firing up the 249cc four-stroke effortless.
Front & Rear Disc Brakes
A 245mm front disc and 203mm rear disc brakes combine to deliver superb stopping power on both paved and unpaved surfaces.
ENGINE
Reliable Four-Stroke Motor
The 249cc air-cooled four-stroke with 9.5:1 compression makes for great on- and off-road performance.
Modern Fuel Injection
The XT250's fuel injection offers smooth throttle response and easy starting in a range of conditions.
Advanced Cylinder Design
A light and strong forged piston inside a plated cylinder helps dissipate heat more efficiently, increasing both performance and durability.
Responsive Power
A light crankshaft provides quick, responsive power.
Five-Speed Transmission
Wide-ratio five-speed transmission provides maximum power and performance in a wide range of terrain and conditions.
Efficient Intake Design
The XT250's straighter intake tract improves performance.
Convenient Electric Start
Hassle-free push-button electric starting adds extra convenience and reliability.
Trail-Ready Chassis
The engine is mounted high in the frame for a trail-ready 11.2 inches of ground clearance.
Low Maintenance Engine
Automatic cam chain tensioner means minimal maintenance and longer engine life.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Strong, Compact Frame
A semi-double-cradle steel frame achieves a lighter, nimbler feel through optimized mass centralization. Greater lateral and torsional rigidity along with reduced weight of the lower frame parts help produce light, stable handling.
Advanced Long-Travel Suspension
The front fork has 8.9 inches of travel to soak up the rough stuff, both on- and off-road while an aluminum lower triple clamp reduces weight.
Nimble Steering
The maximum turning angle of the handlebar is 51 degrees almost like a trials machine combined with a short wheelbase of only 53.5 inches, the XT250 has a super-tight turning radius for excellent maneuverability.
Linkage-Style Shock
A rear shock provides 7.1 inches of wheel travel through a progressive Monocross linkage system for a smooth ride.
Dirt-Ready Wheels
21-inch front and 18-inch rear aluminum wheels are extremely durable and reduce unsprung weight for enhanced suspension performance and handling.
Generous Ground Clearance
Impressive 11.2 inches of ground clearance means you've got serious off-road capability.
ADDITIONAL
Advanced LCD Instruments
Multifunction digital LCD instrument panel with cool green background lighting is easily visible day or night. It also removes unnecessary weight from the handlebar for light, precise handling.
Extended Fuel Range
The stylish gas tank holds a full 2.6 gallons for long-range riding.
Comfortable Saddle
The long, thick seat creates a balanced riding position for optimal movement and comfort.

2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.
Features may include:ENGINE
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

2016 Harley Davidson SuperLow 1200T,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2016-harley-davidson/7578770976.html,7578770976.0,"02/02/2023, 15:36:45","$8,495","When most motorcyclist talk about a touring bike, the exaggerated vision of “large” comes immediately to mind. Tall and heavy, intimidating and hard to maintain control over. Despite the general conceptions, there are exceptions to the rule and the Sportster SuperLow 1200T stands out, providing comfort, storage, style and a 26.1 inch seat height.

Harley “Baggers” normally weigh 800-900 pounds and more, 300-400 pounds more than the 1200T. With a low center of gravity and without the normal Harley “baggage”, the 1200T is easy to maneuver even at low speeds by most. It is not intimidating in it’s power delivery or it’s braking but does both well.

Harley took the 1200 Sportster and dressed it for Touring. They gave it mid-mounted foot controls, extra wide foot pegs and that 26.1 inch seat height. Lockable, Leather covered, weather resistant Saddle Bags are no wider than the handle bars so you do not have to worry about dragging them against anything you have already have passed. The Handle Bars have a nice reach to them without turning you into a parachute going down the road. There is a quick detach Windshield and a 4.5 Gallon Fuel tank that should be good for almost 200 miles at 48mpg. The transmission is a 5-Speed and the motor is Fuel Injected.

Our bike is cosmetically beautiful in its Vivid Black Paint with Silver Pin Stripping. Tires look to be at least 80% and the bike appears to need nothing but a new direction and fuel to go. If you want to ride and tour but not fight with a bike, this will be a great choice.

The selling price is $8,495, miles are 4,387. The VIN# is 1HD1LL318GC441738. For other interesting bikes and collectable vehicles, visit our web site http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 or come by and see us at 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97526. Oregon Dealer DA1287.

2017 Harley Davidson FLTRXS / Road Glide Special,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2017-harley-davidson-fltrxs/7578770661.html,7578770661.0,"02/02/2023, 15:36:46","$14,995","This 2017 Harley Davidson FLTRXS / Road Glide Special marks the end of a riding career for our customer that saw him trading his last bikes in with over 90,000 miles each. With this bike, 60,000 miles in 5 years is a serious demonstration for his love of touring and motorcycling. The condition of the bike also demonstrates his seriousness with his no expense spared attitude towards upkeep and service. All service work has been completed by D&S Harley in Medford until their building burned in 2021 with S&D Custom Cycle of Grants Pass taking over on going and current maintenance.

2017 was the introduction of the 4 Valve Head Milwaukee Eight Engine. The Road Glide was pretty much unchanged other than this being the best equipped Touring Motorcycle Harley offered. The Fairing offers the best weather protection and comfort for their range of bikes along with the full compliment of Electronic Features and Cruise. It was designed to be ridden long distances, providing rider comfort and control.

At about 45,000 miles the spark plugs began fouling and the factory engine was diagnosed with worn valve guides. The owner took the bike to S&D Custom Cycle for repairs and a decision was made to rebuild the entire upper end, at the same time taking the 107 engine and making it a “114”, at cost of $6,700. See the attached receipts for recent service work and the conversion details.

The bike is cosmetically flawless and with a standout presence in Velocity Red Sunglo. The stock Mufflers and other stock items are included with the bike as well as the owner’s manual and second Key Fob.

Miles are 60,092 and the VIN# is 1HD1KTC17HB659986. The selling price is $14,995. For other interesting bikes and collectable vehicles, visit our web site http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 or come by and see us at 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97526. Oregon Dealer DA1287.

2000 Indian Chief,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcy/d/grants-pass-2000-indian-chief/7578769894.html,7578769894.0,"02/02/2023, 15:36:49","$12,995","This 2000 Indian Chief was brought in by a couple who are now living in their RV touring across the country with family. The owner explained the he was an ex-Harley Tech who specialized in carburetors on the V-Twins and that he always love the Indians of the Gilroy era with their S&S Engines. And here we are, many years later.

The 2000 Indian Chief used the S&S Engine, an air-cooled 1442cc, V-Twin bolted to a 5-speed Transmission. Claimed power was 75 HP at 5200 rpm. It was not as heavy as most of the competition of the day at 650 pounds, but still it is not for the faint of heart at stop signs. Rumor has it that only 250 were built in 2000 making the bike a rare sight in a group of riders traveling down the road.

The bike was originally purchased out of a climate controlled storage unit where it had been kept after the New Jersey Indian Dealership closed. The Floridian buyer purchased the motorcycle with no miles on it and the few years that he had it, added just over 800 miles to the clock. Our consigner bought the bike with 812 miles and had it shipped. The oil was changed immediately and once again at 1,200 miles. It presents it’s self as completely stock with two very minor cosmetic defects. On the left side of the front fender at the bottom it has been touched up with matching paint. On the rear right sail panel covering the rear tire there is a tiny mark. The Odometer reads 2,022 miles. Mechanical inspections are welcome prior to purchase by a qualified, local shop.

The bike looks the part, in need of a long weekend with coffee and Semi-Chrome in a warm garage or living room to be in show room new in appearance. There is the stock windshield which is badly cracked plus the hardware for it. There is an owner’s manual also and some minor extra parts.

The VIN# is 5CDCNB510YG004184 and miles showing are 2,022. The selling price is $12,995.

2019 BMW R9T Pure*** 535 miles,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2019-bmw-r9t-pure-535-miles/7578769466.html,7578769466.0,"02/02/2023, 15:36:52","$9,995","When these came out in limited numbers in 2014, you had waiting lines around the block for these soon to be known as the most customized motorcycle ever outside of Harley-Davidson. A little head scratching later, BMW built more, a lot more and then the many variants that have followed.

The Pure version was intended by BMW to present an absolute essential platform form without many of “extras” that some customers demand, that others see as an interference with the true intent of the R9T design. There is no design by Decal and Badging found here. No gimmicks, no fluff, just a motorcycle with the basic electronic hardware most expect, ABS, Fuel Injection and Digital Instrumentation. If you are that rider, this is the bike, minimal fuss, minimal weight and a canvas to create by the owner.

And to our bike. Miles are 585 from new, sold new by Hansen’s BMW of Medford before the fire. Their long time, repeat customer was getting along and needed the maximum from the minimum that the Pure offers. Unfortunately, circumstances have intervened, the bike was rarely ridden and finally is being sold with almost no use. A first service was preformed at Hansen’s and it needs nothing except gas and to be ridden.

The selling price is $9,995. The VIN# is WB10J1305KZ732084 and miles are 535. Please come by and see at Automania LLC, 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, OR 97526. http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 Oregon Dealer DA1287.

2012 Suzuki GSX-R750L,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2012-suzuki-gsx-r750l/7578767942.html,7578767942.0,"02/02/2023, 15:36:53","$10,595","Without attempting to sound dated, I recall wandering into the Grants Pass Suzuki shop in about ‘78 and meeting the owner Ted as he sat warming himself in his chair placed directly over the heat register, coffee in one hand, a cigarette in the other.

Without missing a beat, he asked if I was interested in buying a bike or just there to waste his time. Ted became an instant hero, clear to the point and aware that wasted time cannot be retrieved. The next thirty years saw me take delivery of three bikes from Ted and his son Joe who took over when Ted retired. The two of them represented, to me, transparency and integrity in retail by example. Hopefully Automania LLC will be seen in a similar light when the time arrives.

Forty-four years on, Joe has closed the dealership. Everything was sold except Joe’s own personal bikes. If there is a reward for owning a new Motorcycle Franchise, it must be housed in owning what ever model you desire, knowing what you want added with the ability and means to do so.

And so Joe did. He uncrated a 2012 Suzuki GSX-R750L, did the pre-delivery service and started adding parts!

This is the list of After Market and Factory parts Joe added to the motorcycle, all “dealer installed”. As a bonus of sorts, all of the stock parts were boxed and saved, now coming with the bike for it’s next owner.

1. 2015 Blue Fairing Cowls, Lt & Rt
2. 2015 Fuel tank Graphics
3. Rear passenger “Pillion” seat used for Cargo Bag
4. 2015 GXX-R1000 Tank Graphics for rear Hugger
5. Large and small ring lock Tank Bags with Hardware
6. Adjustable Clutch & Brake Levers
7. Front Brake Lever Guard
8. Carbon Fiber “GSX-R” Tank Pad
9. Aluminum “GXS-R” Chain Guard
10. Vortex Rear Swing Arm Spools
11. Vortex Chassis Protectors (no cut)
12. Vortex Chassis Protector Blue Inserts
13. Saddlemans Gel Seat
14. Woodcraft Engine Case Guards
15. Woodcraft Engine Case Guard Blue Inserts
16. Yoshimura Alpha Exhaust System
17. Woodcraft Lower Swing Arm Chain Guard
18. Hotbodies Rear Hugger Fender
19. Phillip Lockhart Rear Fender Eliminator
20. Michelin Power RS tires with no miles

Regardless of the miles ridden, Joe changed the oils and filters every year. The bike sat on the showroom floor, sort of a trailer queen, managing to collect 3,373 miles since new.

2022 Yamaha YZ65
MOTOCROSS DREAMS START HERE
Designed for the discriminating mini-moto racer with dreams of victory. The YZ65 is the perfect first step into the victory zone.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Potent Two-Stroke Engine
The 65cc two-stroke powerplant features the same advanced technologies found in Yamaha's race-winning YZ125 and YZ250 motocrossers.
Race-Developed Intake
With a carefully tuned Hitachi Astemo Keihin PWK28 carburetor to meter fuel flow, the proven reed-valve induction improves acceleration and throttle response across the entire powerband.
Yamaha Power Valve System
Patented YPVS combines crisp bottom-end torque with potent mid-range and free-revving top-end, making the most of the compact engine and lightweight chassis.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Compact Steel Frame
The YZ65 offers light, neutral handling built on a strong steel cradle frame. Designed around the rigidity balance required for the 65cc class, this frame delivers excellent bump absorption in the roughest track sections, jump landings and whoop sections.
Lightweight Subframe
Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight and convenient maintenance, just like the full-size motocross bikes.
Adjustable Suspension Systems
Up front, a 36mm KYB coil spring fork offers excellent compliance with settings based on Yamaha's extensive testing experience. Out back, a link-less shock design is light and compact and works through a swingarm with YZ125-style chain adjusters. Both front and rear suspension systems are tunable for both rebound and compression damping.
ADDITIONAL
Adjustable Ergonomics
With a four-position adjustable aluminum handlebar clamp, adjustable position clutch and front brake levers, grippy foot pegs and long seat design to help riders move across the bike, the YZ65 is highly tunable to fit riders of various sizes.
Aggressive YZ Family Styling
The YZ65 may be the smallest member of the family, but it packs in the same aggressive styling as the larger YZ and YZ-F siblings. Even down to the slick blue Excel wheels.

2019 Yamaha Niken GT
TURNS HAVE NO SEASONS
Fitted with a range of touring equipment, this Leaning Multi-Wheeler brings added long distance functionality and comfort.Features may include:
Engine
Advanced 3-Cylinder Engine
Derived from the award-winning MT-09, the NIKEN GT features a thrilling 847cc liquid-cooled inline 3-cylinder motor packing a range of advanced technologies. With DOHC heads, an oversquare 78mm x 59.1mm bore and stroke and 11.5:1 compression ratio, NIKEN GT delivers an exciting, torquey character, refined with additional crankshaft inertia for smooth starts.Crossp Concept CP3 Engine
By utilizing the naturally smooth firing order and power characteristics of the 3-cylinder motor, Yamaha's CP3 engine produces extremely linear torque with an excellent feeling of connection between the throttle grip and engine. To boost refinement and improve rider and passenger comfort, the motor features a geared counterbalancer to minimize engine vibration. This results in a responsive powerplant that combines the best aspects of both 2- and 4-cylinder motors while still light, slim and compact.Advanced Yamaha Engine Technology
The CP3 engine uses forged 'fracture-split' connecting rods, where the big-end ring of a connecting rod is split in two to create a more precise mating surface when they are bolted together again around the crankshaft. The cylinder block is offset towards the front wheel, to reduce piston force against the cylinder walls, improving efficiency. And the cylinder boars are plated with a ceramic composite for excellent durability and heat transfer.
Electronics
Advanced YCC-T® Engine Control
The ride-by-wire Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) system senses the slightest throttle input by the rider, relays the data to the ECU, which instantaneously calculates the ideal throttle valve opening based on engine rpm and throttle opening, and then sends commands to a servo-motor actuator that moves the throttle valve which actively controls the intake airflow volume. This technology contributes to the rider’s feeling of torque and controllability from the 3-cylinder engine.Selectable D-MODE
The NIKEN GT features Yamaha's D-Mode system to allow the rider to choose the optimum engine character for their riding situation and preferences. The rider can choose from three throttle valve control maps for different throttle response characteristics at the push of a button.Adjustable Traction Control System
A Traction Control System (TCS) assists the rider in managing traction on various road conditions by quickly modulating throttle opening, ignition timing and fuel volume. The NIKEN GT TCS includes two modes to suit various road conditions, and can also be disabled by the rider if they so choose.
Chassis/Suspension
Class-Defying Leaning Multi-Wheel Chassis
Yamaha's advanced LMW (Leaning Multi-Wheel) chassis is the result of countless hours of engieering and testing to create a unique motorcycle control system that provides unparalleled rider confidence no matter what the road conditions. With two front tires leaning in unison the NIKEN GT doubles the amount of available grip for exceptional stopping power, cornering and rider comfort, especially over uneven and poor road conditions.Unique Double-Tube/Dual-Axis Steering Design
The radical front end of thge NIKEN GT uses paired fork tubes for each front wheel and steering linkages to provide ideal steering geometry and natural steering feel. The system turns and leans like a conventional motorcycle, but with twice the front tire grip. And, like other Yamaha sportbikes, this system provides adjustable compression and rebound damping for a highly tunable ride.

2022 Yamaha YZ450F
TUNE IN TO VICTORY
Class-leading performance and the industry's only free smartphone Power Tuner app make the YZ450F the bike of choice for race winners.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
Featuring a distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design, the YZ450F's light, compact engine is ideally positioned within the frame for optimized weight distribution. Internally, steep valve angles allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port. More aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint work together with a higher compression bridge-box-design piston, DLC-coated piston pin and longer connecting rod to churn out a broad, usable powerband, all thoughtfully packaged to provide an exceptional level of chassis balance and control.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app for on-the-fly adjustments to changing track and weather conditions.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
An advanced aluminum bilateral beam frame features precisely tuned flex characteristics that give riders the ultimate combination of cornering performance, traction feel and bump stability. By tuning the rigidity balance of the chassis in concert with changes to the lateral beams, engine cradle tube thickness, engine mounting points and triple clamps, the 2022 YZ450F takes rider confidence to new levels.
Revised Class-Leading Suspension
THigh-spec fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption. The linkage-type rear suspension features a KYB shock with damping characteristics to match the YZ450F's race-tuned chassis. Newly revised settings take full advantage of the lightened rear wheel assembly to further improve performance.
High Performance Braking System
A large 270mm front rotor is coupled with a rigid caliper and aggressive pad material for excellent braking performance and machine control. Out back, the rear system sheds weight with a compact caliper and 240mm rear rotor for better heat dissipation.
ADDITIONAL
Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The top triple clamp design balances rigidity for improved steering feel while the four-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber-mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Race-Winning Details
The YZ450F boasts top-spec details including 1-1/8-inch aluminum tapered handlebars, wide foot pegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and a lightweight gold drive chain.

It was lovingly restored by a 4th generation tool maker. All components were professionally sandblasted and powder coated. This is not a rattle can job. All fasteners are stainless steel. Every bearing in it was replaced including the drive system needle bearings. New tires, chain and reproduction seat. The motor is a brand new small block started and ridden once. This means new case, piston, crank, rod, flywheel etc. It was front and rear breaks and the original light.

You will not find another like this. This bike is built like a machine tool not an old swing set. It is 10 time the bike that you would get buying something current off the market.

It is hard for me to part with, but here it is.

Let me know if you have any questions.

It can be seen in Ashland Oregon.

Thanks for looking.

2022 Yamaha YZ450F Monster Energy Yamaha Racing Edition
GET THERE. START HERE.
Get the look of a full factory ride with your own Monster Energy-inspired, class-leading YZ450F.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
Featuring a distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design, the YZ450F's light, compact engine is ideally positioned within the frame for optimized weight distribution. Internally, steep valve angles allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port. More aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint work together with a higher compression bridge-box-design piston, DLC-coated piston pin and longer connecting rod to churn out a broad, usable powerband, all thoughtfully packaged to provide an exceptional level of chassis balance and control.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app for on-the-fly adjustments to changing track and weather conditions.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
An advanced aluminum bilateral beam frame features precisely tuned flex characteristics that give riders the ultimate combination of cornering performance, traction feel and bump stability. By tuning the rigidity balance of the chassis in concert with changes to the lateral beams, engine cradle tube thickness, engine mounting points and triple clamps, the 2022 YZ450F takes rider confidence to new levels.
Revised Class-Leading Suspension
High-spec fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption. The linkage-type rear suspension features a KYB shock with damping characteristics to match the YZ450F's race-tuned chassis. Newly revised settings take full advantage of the lightened rear wheel assembly to further improve performance.
High Performance Braking System
A large 270mm front rotor is coupled with a rigid caliper and aggressive pad material for excellent braking performance and machine control. Out back, the rear system sheds weight with a compact caliper and 240mm rear rotor for better heat dissipation.
ADDITIONAL
Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The top triple clamp design balances rigidity for improved steering feel while the four-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber-mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Race-Winning Details
The YZ450F boasts top-spec details including 1-1/8-inch aluminum tapered handlebars, wide foot pegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and a lightweight gold drive chain.

This Honda has had two owners, including myself, was garage kept for most of its life, and is currently covered and canopied.

Bike is stock except for:
-TST Flushmount LED front turn signals
-TST LED relay
-Highsider Victory Blast Short Arm Bar End Mirrors
-Firepower O-Ring 520 chain (installed less than 300 miles ago)
-Continental ContiRoad Sport Touring Tires (installed about a year ago with maybe 1.5k miles on them)
-Barkbuster Storm Handguards
-Original mirrors and bar ends will come with the bike

It's a 250CC engine, so it's not a superbike but it accelerates quickly and is fun for a new rider or someone who wants something more flickable and fun. It makes 23.7 horsepower and 14.65 lb-ft of torque. The bike has 16,896 miles on it at the time of posting, but I do commute with it and that number might go up. It's never been downed, but has been dropped in my yard once with no damage. Minor scratches are on the front fairing near the headlight, were from the previous owner. It runs great, starts up no problem, and is an all-around solid bike that averages around 74 miles per gallon and has a range a little over 150 miles.

I'm selling because I bought an adventure bike, but I still ride this now and again so I'm not in a hurry, but am open to reasonable offers. Recently reduced to reflect changes in the market.

SUPER CLEAN BIKE, LOTS OF EXTRAS!
2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8 aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

2022 Yamaha YZ450FX
POWER, TUNED TO PERFECTION
Whether cutting through tight technical trails or blazing across the wide open desert, the class-defining YZ450FX takes off-road performance to new levels.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
The YZ450FX's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted down-draft intake system features a cylinder head that works with the frame geometry for optimized weight distribution. Internally, the engine features a straight intake tract, aggressive cam profiles, a high-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin and more. Finally, the YZ450FX features specific ECU settings to suit the needs of cross country riders.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Engine Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing riding conditions. Map 1 provides more responsive, quicker revving engine characteristics while Map 2 provides smoother response, slower revving characteristics for when traction is limited.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
The upper frame bracing provides rigidity and durability while rear frame spars and cross country-tuned engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of impact absorption, stiffness and rider feeling.
Class-Leading Suspension
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension uses a KYB shock with specially-tuned damping characteristics to match the YZ450FX chassis with both front and rear system settings for optimal GNCC performance.

Large 270mm front rotor coupled with aggressive pad material offer excellent braking performance and feel with exceptional stopping power and controllability.
ADDITIONAL

Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
Four-position adjustable handlebar clamps are rubber mounted to improve comfort, reduce handlebar vibration and allow riders to adjust the bar position, while the oversize 1-1/8-inch handlebar is strong but lightweight.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

2022 Yamaha YZ250X
2-STROKES. 1 GOAL.
Engineered with all the reliability and durability you've come to expect from Yamaha, this 2-stroke was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
ENGINE
GNCC-Tuned YZ250 Power
Based on the legendary YZ250 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine, the YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, exhaust port timing, revised Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) timing and a model-specific CDI unit all focused on creating a wide, controllable power character ideal for cross country racing.
Revised Power Valve
The YZ250X features the patented Yamaha Power Valve System with broader opening timing compared to the YZ250 for smoother power to combine bottom-end acceleration with strong mid-range and top-end.
Narrow Exhaust Pipe
Unique compact exhaust expansion chamber is designed especially for the YZ250X to improve both horizontal and vertical clearance on tight, technical trails while still providing excellent exhaust efficiency.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Industry-Leading KYB Fork
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB spring-type fork with speed-sensitive damping uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling and a smooth ride. With minimal wasted stroke or abrupt shocks for the rider, this bike is tuned for the demands of cross country racing.
Smooth KYB Shock
Fully adjustable KYB rear shock features 12.4 inches of travel, separate adjusters for high- and low-speed compression damping and a full lock oil rebound system for increased comfort, control and fantastic rear wheel traction in challenging conditions.
YZ250-Based Frame
A carefully engineered aluminum frame and swingarm give the YZ250X the famous handling proven by the championship-winning YZ motocross riders on tracks around the world.
ADDITIONAL
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.

PURIST, REDUCED, SELF-CONFIDENT
Reduced to the essential. But full of self-confidence. The BMW R nineT Pure. The powerful air/oil-cooled engine gives you goosebumps on the tarmac. Its classic roadster look with the compact fuel tank and slim rear reminds you of the early days of BMW Motorrad.

Give your ideas free rein and immerse yourself in the world of #Soulfuel with the R nineT Pure.
Features may include:
Adjustable spring strut
The new shock absorber with progressive damping is not only striking and eye-catching, but is also functional as it can also be manually adjusted using the knob.
Modern LED turn indicators
The LED indicators ensure a highly visible appearance from all perspectives and more visibility when turning.
Twin-cylinder boxer engine
The design of the engine looks even tidier with the new cylinder head covers and throttle bodies.
Compact tank
With its design it unmistakably speaks the language of the R nineT family.
Classic round speedometer
In the style of classic BMW roadsters, the analog classic circular instrument shows you only what you really need to ride.
High-flow exhaust system
With the optionally available silencer of the R nineT, you can enhance the typical roadster look of the Pure and enjoy an even richer sound.
Classically-painted front-wheel cover
The painted front-wheel cover rounds off the appearance consistently.

2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.
Features may include:ENGINE
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

Here is one of the most tastfully customized BMW R9T (1200cc) motorcycles you'll ever see. I had a guy in Ireland who was ready to buy and ship this out. This is one of the most perfect ""cafe"" bike you'll ever see but with sane ergonomics and BMW reliability and shaft drive.

Thousands ($$) in options including the following:

- Beautiful black leather Corbin seat that provides ""the"" look while maintaining comfort and control over any condition.
- Rizoma black cafe low rise aluminum handlebars with custom clutch and front brake levers, perfectly placed for control and speed.
- Cafe billet bar end mirrors on both ends, and after market grips for better control.
- Rizoma turn signals on all 4 corners, barely visible but very bright and they don't blink rapidly like crap signals do without proper relays.
- Rizoma license plate relocation module that puts the plate down low on the right rear of the bike, with its own light above the plate for legality.
- Rizoma billet footpegs, shift lever and rear brake lever - great looks, high quality billet
- Carbon fiber and matte black muffler (I believe it's a Remus, the label was removed prior to my ownership), light and just moderately loud without drawing attention to anyone. I strongly dislike loud bikes and this one is perfectly authoratative without being obnoxious. You know it's not a sewing machine.
- Carbon fiber intake snorkle
- Carbon fiber front engine (alternator) cover
- Wunderlich oil cooler cover
- Custom hand gold pinstriped (not stickers) on the beautifully flawless factory black metal fuel tank and front fender. You will not find its equal. Flawlessly applied by an artist. This feature separates this bike from all the others.

I personally bought this bike new and have taken excellent care of it. It has always been kept covered in a heated garage. If it was going to be in the hot sun for a few hours, I would always put a white towel over the seat. I know that might seem a little obsessive, but it also tells you how well I took care of my bike. I paid over 24K when I bought it new, which also includes the over 5K worth of accessories. Just to name a few of the add on’s/accessories: Custom touring seat (very comfortable for both rider and passenger), alarm system, Screamin' Eagle two pipe exhaust (sounds great) , and Hard Chrome lockable Saddle Bags just to name a few. When I am out with it, the bike always turns heads, even if the people are not really even into bikes, they still come over and many times ask if its new and also mention how beautiful it is. Another great thing about this bike is, because it sits low, it’s great for a man or a woman. The $10,500 is firm, I’ve lowered it to an excellent price and I will also throw in a half helmet and a full helmet that I got straight from Harley, the helmets also match the two tone bike.
I just added a few additional pictures which do not include the additional 1/2 helmet or the two bike covers. The two helmets alone are an additional $500 value.
I also included the Kelly Blue Book price that is stated. The price they have at $7860 is the most basic model that you can buy, it’s not even the two tone. If you look at what is circled in red, the price will make more sense to you.
KBB - $7860
Extras -$5000
Added helmets- $500
2 Bike covers - let’s just say $140 to make it easy!
Total comes to $13,500 and the bike is also in excellent condition which is not the bike that is on KBB. As you can see, I’m selling my bike for $10,500 which is easily a $3000 discount. Must See to really appreciate!",gas,6875.0,manual,,excellent,clean,1130.0,silver,yes,cruiser,,,,,

2022 Yamaha Tracer 9 GT
TURN UP YOUR EXPERIENCE
Featuring an all-new engine and premium sport touring features that come standard, the most versatile touring partner for when you're commuting or riding across the mountains.
Features may include:
ENGINE
All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.
ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

This 321cc liquid-cooled two-cylinder engine features lightweight forged pistons and carburized connecting rods, delivering easy to manage power in the low rpm range with strong high rpm power. The extremely light clutch feeling makes the MT-03 even more fun in the city, while its offset cylinders and advanced fuel injection system ensures smooth throttle response.
Dual Position Lights with Singular LED Headlight
The dynamic MT-03 looks cool with its dual angled position lights that emphasize its aggressive big-bike looks. A single compact and powerful LED headlight burns a hole through the darkness to light up the road ahead.
ENGINE
Potent Twin-Cylinder Powerplant
Yamaha's 321cc liquid-cooled, inline two-cylinder engine delivers excellent power and performance throughout the rpm range. With a 180-degree crank design and integrated counterbalancer, the layout minimizes vibrations for a smooth, refined engine character.
Smooth & Useable Power
With double overhead cams (DOHC) and four-valve cylinder heads, the MT-03 engine provides easy-to-manage power at low rpms with strong rpm power ultimately delivering an exciting ride with a broad spread of power.
Six-Speed Transmission
A smooth-shifting six-speed gearbox ensures the rider always has the right ratio, whether riding through tight city streets or on the open highway.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Inverted KYB Front Fork
The MT-03 features an inverted KYB fork with optimized spring and damping settings, delivering more solid handling when compared to motorcycles using conventional front forks.
Monocross Rear Shock
The seven-step preload adjustable single-shock design is tuned to strike a balance between ride comfort and sporty performance with capability across a wide range of uses, from urban commuting to extended rides into the twisty canyons.
Long Swingarm
The MT-03 is equipped with a 22.6-inch long asymmetrical swingarm that provides a planted ride during braking, cornering and acceleration.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Stylish LED Turn Signals
Light-Emitting Diode (LED) elements are used for both the front and rear turn signals. Not only do LEDs offer long life with minimal power draw, they provide brilliant illumination for confidence and visibility, during the day or night. The MT-03's dynamic appearance is reinforced by the LED signals that perfectly complement the bike's aggressive looks.
Dynamic Mass Forward Design
Yamaha's Hyper Naked bikes are instantly recognizable thanks to their aggressive and powerful design. A sculpted fuel tank cover is designed to fit snugly with the rider while the lightweight air scoops enhance the look and feel of the mass-forward body design and highlight the dynamic MT family look.
Ergonomic Riding Position
With its compact body and low 30.7-inch seat height, the MT-03 is a joy to ride whether you're escaping traffic or having a blast out on the open road. Behind the aggressive bodywork, a specially sculpted knee area and fuel tank cover work with the high-mounted handlebars to provide an agile and ergonomic riding position.
Digital LCD Instrumentation
To match the MT-03 Hyper Naked's radical looks, Yamaha has fitted a stylish LCD meter that provides easy-to-absorb information.

2023 Yamaha Tenere 700
THE NEXT HORIZON IS YOURS
A lightweight, no compromise adventure bike with outstanding reliability opens up a new world of possibilities.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The Tenere 700 features a fuel-injected, 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin-cylinder engine derived from Yamaha's award-winning MT-07. This compact powerplant features an ideal power delivery for adventure riding, for tractable and controllable power in every riding condition.
Adventure-Focused Ergonomics
The Tenere 700 features a narrow body, slim fuel tank, and flat seat allowing maximum agility, enabling the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence on dirt or asphalt. The protective fairing and handguards work with the tapered handlebar to ensure comfort on the longest rides.
ENGINE
Compact, High-Tech Engine
Developed from the stellar MT-07 Hyper Naked sportbike, the Tenere 700 engine combines exceptional reliability and exciting power delivery in a compact, fuel-efficient package. With an overall size similar to some single-cylinder motors, the 689cc fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, DOHC inline twin gives the Tenere 700 a slim feel for exceptional off-road confidence, while the counterbalanced two-cylinder design provides smooth, long-legged power ideal for long days in the saddle.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank which traces its lineage directly to the Dakar-dominating XTZ750 race bikes to provide linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. The CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact, and offers an excellent level of rider/machine communication.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Lightweight Double Cradle Frame Design
A lightweight, high-strength tubular steel frame provides a tuned rigidity balance for nimble, responsive handling with the strength and durability needed to tackle the harshest terrain with confidence. The chassis utilizes a short 62.6-inch wheelbase for agility and boasts 9.5 inches of ground clearance to tackle whatever the trail throws at you.
Balanced Ergonomics
The ability to shift body weight forward and rearward to suit the terrain is crucial in off-road riding situations, so the Tenere 700 features a flat seat and slim body that allows maximum rider agility. The narrow body and fuel tank also enable the rider to grip the tank whether sitting or standing, giving added confidence whether you're riding on dirt or asphalt.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Rally-Bred LED Lighting
Echoing the focused, purposeful design of rally-built works racing machines, the Tenere 700 utilizes a clear headlight nacelle with quad LED headlights. This vertically-stacked two-plus-two headlight design provides aggressive looks and excellent visibility, while the LEDs themselves are bright, long-lasting and resistant to shock and vibration.
Protective, Versatile Cockpit
The rally-inspired upper fairing and standard handguards ensure wind and weather protection ideal for long riding days. The taper aluminum handlebar is positioned for a relaxed riding position when sitting or standing on the pegs. The cockpit is also designed to accommodate additional navigation devices, such as a GPS or rally road book.

Along with the slimmer, more aggressive bodywork, a new front and rear fender design and new radiator shrouds all integrate with a bold new graphics scheme to highlight the YZ family pedigree. Premium Yamaha graphics are now embedded to provide excellent durability and scratch resistance.

2023 Yamaha Bolt R-Spec
BORN WITH PERFORMANCE
Featuring a torquey V-Twin engine, this performance bobber combines old-school soul and modern form.
Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Urban Performance Styling
The Bolt R-Spec is stripped down with minimal chrome, epitomizing the Urban Performance Bobber look. The compact chassis proudly showcases the 58-cubic-inch (942cc) air-cooled 60-degree V-twin powerplant.
Rider-Focused Engine
The Bolt R-Spec uses Yamaha's advanced technology to create a riding experience superior to other similarly sized machines. Fuel injection and ignition timing maps have been chosen specifically for this bike to deliver class-leading performance with strong low- and mid-range torque that's sure to bring a smile to every rider's face.
Compact, Stable Chassis
The slim body and low seat design combine to give the Bolt R-Spec light maneuverability and a stable handling feel. The upright riding posture helps the rider feel the wind, hear the sounds and experience the pulse of the machine.
ENGINE
Air-Cooled V-Twin
The 58-cubic-inch (942cc) engine is an air-cooled SOHC 60-degree V-twin with four valves per cylinder, a pent-roof shaped combustion chamber and 9.0:1 compression ratio. The engine is designed to provide excellent power and superior low-end torque.
Low Friction Internals
Special roller-type rocker arms with needle bearings are used to keep friction loss to a minimum, increase durability and help the engine achieve the ideal performance characteristics.
Advanced Cylinder Design
The pent-roof combustion chamber shape was precisely engineered to direct the fuel/air charge to the center of the piston for more efficient combustion and maximum power. Ceramic-composite plated cylinders provide excellent heat dissipation and reduced oil consumption.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Handling-Focused Frame
A double-cradle frame provides precise handling and enhances city riding enjoyment thanks to the rigid mount system mounting the engine directly to the frame.
Low Seat Height
The low-set seat provides a great riding position while being a mere 27.2 inches off the pavement, so most riders can easily put both feet firmly on the ground at a stop.
Agile Wheelbase
Bolt R-Spec's short, 61.8-inch wheelbase contributes to the bike's great handling, providing precise, tight turns in city riding and solid, stable handling on the open road.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Modern Lighting
LED rear taillight looks cool and adds to the modern bobber appeal.
Slick Instruments
Compact digital LCD meter assembly provides clean styling with excellent visibility.
Real Steel Fenders
Steel front and rear fenders are ideal for personalization, including paint and customization.
Bobber-Style Seat
Solo rider saddle adds to the minimalist bobber look while providing support for longer rides.

ENGINE
Powerful 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The MT-09 features the renowned 890cc liquid-cooled CP3 engine. Bore and stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and an 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with thrilling power delivery characteristics. The combination of exceptional combustion efficiency and light weight results in an impressive 49 MPG.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Lightweight Aluminum Frame
The MT-09 features an advanced, lightweight aluminum frame refined to showcase the MT's signature agility. To ensure both straight-line stability and handling performance, the balance of longitudinal, lateral and torsional rigidity are all carefully considered and finely tuned. The frame is manufactured using the latest in Yamaha's controlled filling (CF) die casting technology which contributes to the MT-09 being one of the lightest bikes in its class at just 417 pounds.
Aluminum Die Cast Subframe
The MT-09 also employs a controlled filling aluminum die-cast subframe that reduces weight and further contributes to the model's signature feeling of agility.
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
Next-Generation Design
With the MT-09 designers sought to better express the major advances made with the machine's performance by visually accentuating the pure power of the bike. The minimalist design concept delivers an exterior with everything but the essentials stripped away to highlight lightness and agility while stimulating the rider's senses.
ELECTRONICS
Advanced Six-Axis IMU
The MT-09 features an advanced six-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that retains the base performance of proven IMU in the YZF-R1 but is 50% smaller and 40% lighter due to a thorough review of the sensor layout. The engine control unit (ECU) that receives and reflects the data from the IMU is equipped with three rider aids: a Traction Control System (TCS), Slide Control System (SCS) and front-wheel LIFt control system (LIF). All three systems work together to help the rider concentrate on riding to better extract the machine's potential. Each of the systems can also be turned on or off and have their levels of intervention adjusted to preference. With this best-in-class electronic control technology, the MT-09 gives you the ultimate control in varying weather and surface conditions.
Rider-Supporting Traction Control System
The Traction Control System (TCS) has three modes: Mode 1, Mode 2 and Mode M for manual settings. Each mode integrates the three rider support systems by changing the degree of intervention for the TCS, SCS and LIF all at once. With Mode M, the user can select his/her preferred levels of intervention for the TCS, SCS and LIF individually.

2022 Yamaha MT-07
DARK ATTRACTION
Featuring a distinctive next generation look and features, as well as an advanced twin-cylinder engine. Experience the best balance of performance and value the Dark Side has to offer.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Advanced Twin-Cylinder Engine
The MT-07 features an updated, compact 689cc liquid-cooled, inline twin cylinder, DOHC engine with fuel injection. The unique power character of the engine provides outstanding low- to mid-range torque with a linear throttle response and strong high-rpm pulling power. Maximizing riding excitement in the real world, the engine maintains the same level of response due to its intake air duct design, exhaust system specs - now integrated 2-into-1 exhaust pipes and muffler - and updated ECU specs. The fuel injection settings were also optimized to bring refinements to the engine's linear response characteristics while the throttle is slightly open at low rpm. Other updates include new valve seats with excellent abrasion resistance for the exhaust side, improved gearshift feel thanks to different cut angles for the dog gears, and repositioning for the catalytic converter - now closer to the headers - and oxygen sensor.
Crossplane Crankshaft Concept
The two-cylinder engine features Yamaha's Crossplane Crankshaft Concept 270-degree crank that provides linear torque development in response to the rider's throttle input. Offering excellent rider-machine communication, the CP2 engine is also light, slim and compact.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Assertive Riding Position
To alleviate any sense of narrowness, the MT-07 features a new tapered handlebar that is 32mm wider and 19mm taller and offers improved feelings of control and comfort for a wider range of rider sizes.
Compact Frame Design
The high-strength steel frame provides an optimized balance of rigidity for nimble, agile handling. As a stressed member of the chassis, the engine allows for a lighter, more compact main frame design, contributing to a low wet weight of only 406 lb.
ADDITIONAL
New LCD Meter
The MT-07 features a new multifunction negative-display LCD dash with a black background and white readouts while RPMS of 10k - 12k are indicated with a red color. Designed specifically for the MT-07's cockpit, the arrangement of the information features a larger display for the clock, current gear, trip/odometers and tachometer. Trip 1, Trip 2 and Trip F, the temperature and other meter functions can be toggled and reset with the left handlebar thumb switch while key displays like the gear indicator are on the right while the tachometer are positioned along the top.
Next-Generation Design
Joining the 3rd generation MT style - as featured on the MT-09 - the MT-07's new look further brings out its distinctive appeal with fashion-leading colors and graphics. The newly designed parts and components are integrated with minimal structural elements, creating an attractive design that emphasizes pure Hyper Naked character. With a silhouette that is synonymous with the MT Series' signature statement of torque and power, the MT-07 showcases a tight, compact and powerful appearance.

2022 Yamaha YZ450F Monster Energy Yamaha Racing Edition
GET THERE. START HERE.
Get the look of a full factory ride with your own Monster Energy-inspired, class-leading YZ450F.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Compact Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
Featuring a distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design, the YZ450F's light, compact engine is ideally positioned within the frame for optimized weight distribution. Internally, steep valve angles allow for an even straighter down-draft intake port. More aggressive cam profiles and larger diameter exhaust header joint work together with a higher compression bridge-box-design piston, DLC-coated piston pin and longer connecting rod to churn out a broad, usable powerband, all thoughtfully packaged to provide an exceptional level of chassis balance and control.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Fuel Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app for on-the-fly adjustments to changing track and weather conditions.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
An advanced aluminum bilateral beam frame features precisely tuned flex characteristics that give riders the ultimate combination of cornering performance, traction feel and bump stability. By tuning the rigidity balance of the chassis in concert with changes to the lateral beams, engine cradle tube thickness, engine mounting points and triple clamps, the 2022 YZ450F takes rider confidence to new levels.
Revised Class-Leading Suspension
High-spec fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption. The linkage-type rear suspension features a KYB shock with damping characteristics to match the YZ450F's race-tuned chassis. Newly revised settings take full advantage of the lightened rear wheel assembly to further improve performance.
High Performance Braking System
A large 270mm front rotor is coupled with a rigid caliper and aggressive pad material for excellent braking performance and machine control. Out back, the rear system sheds weight with a compact caliper and 240mm rear rotor for better heat dissipation.
ADDITIONAL
Triple Clamp with Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The top triple clamp design balances rigidity for improved steering feel while the four-position adjustable handlebar clamp is rubber-mounted for comfort, reduced handlebar vibration and easily tunable bar position.
Race-Winning Details
The YZ450F boasts top-spec details including 1-1/8-inch aluminum tapered handlebars, wide foot pegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and a lightweight gold drive chain.

CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Compact Steel Frame

Removable aluminum rear subframe is constructed of square-section tubing for reduced weight and convenient maintenance, just like the full-size motocross bikes.
Adjustable Suspension Systems

2022 Yamaha YZ450FX
POWER, TUNED TO PERFECTION
Whether cutting through tight technical trails or blazing across the wide open desert, the class-defining YZ450FX takes off-road performance to new levels.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Rearward-Slanted Cylinder Design
The YZ450FX's distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted down-draft intake system features a cylinder head that works with the frame geometry for optimized weight distribution. Internally, the engine features a straight intake tract, aggressive cam profiles, a high-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin and more. Finally, the YZ450FX features specific ECU settings to suit the needs of cross country riders.
Innovative Yamaha Power Tuner App
The free-of-charge Yamaha Power Tuner app brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time and more.
Adjustable Engine Mapping
A handlebar-mounted map switch allows the rider to quickly select between preloaded engine maps loaded and configured in the Power Tuner app to account for changing riding conditions. Map 1 provides more responsive, quicker revving engine characteristics while Map 2 provides smoother response, slower revving characteristics for when traction is limited.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Advanced Bilateral Aluminum Frame
The upper frame bracing provides rigidity and durability while rear frame spars and cross country-tuned engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of impact absorption, stiffness and rider feeling.
Class-Leading Suspension
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension uses a KYB shock with specially-tuned damping characteristics to match the YZ450FX chassis with both front and rear system settings for optimal GNCC performance.
270mm Front Brake
Large 270mm front rotor coupled with aggressive pad material offer excellent braking performance and feel with exceptional stopping power and controllability.
ADDITIONAL
GNCC-Focused Details
The YZ450FX includes a range of cross country specific upgrades compared to the YZ450F motocrosser including a composite engine guard, 18-inch rear wheel, sealed O-ring chain, fuel level warning indicator and a folding aluminum kickstand.
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
Four-position adjustable handlebar clamps are rubber mounted to improve comfort, reduce handlebar vibration and allow riders to adjust the bar position, while the oversize 1-1/8-inch handlebar is strong but lightweight.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.

Comments for this 2018 Yamaha YZ450F:
SUPER CLEAN BIKE, LOTS OF EXTRAS!
2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8 aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

2022 Yamaha YZ250X
2-STROKES. 1 GOAL.
Engineered with all the reliability and durability you've come to expect from Yamaha, this 2-stroke was born to win Cross Country races.
Features may include:
ENGINE
GNCC-Tuned YZ250 Power
Based on the legendary YZ250 249cc liquid-cooled reed-valve-inducted two-stroke engine, the YZ250X utilizes a revised compression ratio, exhaust port timing, revised Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) timing and a model-specific CDI unit all focused on creating a wide, controllable power character ideal for cross country racing.
Revised Power Valve
The YZ250X features the patented Yamaha Power Valve System with broader opening timing compared to the YZ250 for smoother power to combine bottom-end acceleration with strong mid-range and top-end.
Narrow Exhaust Pipe
Unique compact exhaust expansion chamber is designed especially for the YZ250X to improve both horizontal and vertical clearance on tight, technical trails while still providing excellent exhaust efficiency.
CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
Industry-Leading KYB Fork
The industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB spring-type fork with speed-sensitive damping uses piston speed to control the damping force for super-precise handling and a smooth ride. With minimal wasted stroke or abrupt shocks for the rider, this bike is tuned for the demands of cross country racing.
Smooth KYB Shock
Fully adjustable KYB rear shock features 12.4 inches of travel, separate adjusters for high- and low-speed compression damping and a full lock oil rebound system for increased comfort, control and fantastic rear wheel traction in challenging conditions.
YZ250-Based Frame
A carefully engineered aluminum frame and swingarm give the YZ250X the famous handling proven by the championship-winning YZ motocross riders on tracks around the world.
ADDITIONAL
Cross Country Ergonomics
A racy gripper -type seat and narrow fuel tank combined with a tapered aluminum handlebar and adjustable mounts create greater freedom of movement and more comfortable ergonomics for riders.

All-New 890cc Liquid-Cooled Three-Cylinder DOHC Fuel-Injected Engine
The Tracer 9 GT features a newly developed 890cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder, DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder fuel-injected (YCC-T) engine with a downdraft intake. The bore e- stroke of 78 mm e- 62.1 mm and 11.5:1 compression ratio provide outstanding torque with strong power delivery characteristics. Almost all of the fundamental parts of the engine, from the pistons and connecting rods to the crankshaft, camshafts and crankcase, have all been redesigned. The combustion efficiency results in an impressive 9% improvement as well as an increased fuel efficiency to 49 MPG.
Redesigned Fuel Delivery System
The fuel delivery system has been completely redesigned. On former Tracer 9 GTs, the fuel injectors were attached directly to the cylinder head, but the fuel injectors of the Tracer 9 GT are now attached to the throttle valve side of the throttle bodies. The injectors now spray at the back of the intake valve heads to promote atomization of the fuel and reduce adhesion of fuel particles to the port walls, producing outstanding combustion efficiency. The throttle valve is operated using the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) electronic system which has been widely proven on YZF series models as well as the earlier Tracer 9 GT models.CHASSIS/SUSPENSION
New Lightweight Aluminum Frame
To achieve both sporty performance and excellent riding comfort, the new Tracer 9 GT adopts a newly developed lightweight aluminum frame with model-specific tuning. Using the latest Controlled Filling (CF) aluminum die-casting technology, this frame features the thinnest sections ever on a Yamaha die-cast frame at just 1.7 mm (thinnest section on the 2020 Tracer 900's frame is 3.5 mm).
Strong Steel Subframe
The Tracer 9 GT's steel subframe ensures excellent straight-line stability and cornering ability, even when outfitted with a large fuel tank and three hard rear luggage cases.ADDITIONAL
All-New Design
The Tracer 9 GT's next-generation style expresses not only its sporty ride but its refined mobility and functionality. The aerodynamic front fairing creates a silhouette that showcases the bike's tightly packed chassis and powerful forward drive while perfectly integrating the functions and elements needed for a comfortable and convenient ride.
Full LED Lighting With Cornering Lights
The compact mono-focus (separate high and low beam units) LED headlights in a twin-eye arrangement provide excellent beam spread for the Tracer 9 GT. The edges of the beam have a softer contrast to be easy on the eyes while emitting a soft and even spread of illumination. Since the Tracer 9 GT uses not one but multiple LEDs to produce light, it can project a complex distribution of illumination across a broad field. The position lights also use LEDs for a wider field of illumination while the redesigned rear lights give off a smoother plane of light. The cornering lights help improve rider's confidence at night as the light strength grows as the lean angle increases. Following the FJR1300ES, this is the second Yamaha model to feature a cornering light system but the only one with a single LED unit per side that emits increasingly stronger source of light in a high-quality, highly functional design.

I believe it to be manufactured in China and distributed by X-Pro in the USA. It was delivered to me in the original packing case. I completed assembly and obtained (with some difficulty) an Oregon title and registration. The saddle is 36"" above ground, and my arthritis prevents me from easily getting on it, so I'm selling it. It is a brand new bike, and has only been test-ridden to verify proper shifting. the odometer shows 1.7 miles. I bought it as a 250 cc, a consumers emission information tag says it's manufactured by Chongqing Haosen Motorcycle Co., Ltd, model HS 250 Y-A, 229 cc 4-stroke, air-cooled carburetor engine. The battery that came with the bike was weak, so I bought ($50+) a larger ski-doo battery. but it doesn't fit the compartment, so I lashed it in. Buyer may want to replace it with a smaller battery. $1600. Might trade for a 300-500 cc bike or scooter.

No test rides, as it's a brand new bike, so I want to keep the odometer where it is at 1.7 miles.",gas,1.0,manual,LOWHDN109N1000019,new,clean,229.0,green,yes,dual,,,,,

Dang you can really get one used already. Yup!!

Sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction. These days we’ve got three billionaires – Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk – trying to one-up each other in the space race. Ever the showman, Branson beat Bezos by a week in their personal quests to become space cowboys. If you want to book a galactic flight, a ticket could set you back a cool $250,000.

What a waste. You can reach hyperspace right here on Earth for less than a tenth as much. Just head down to your local Suzuki dealer and fork over $18,599 for a new Hayabusa. All you have to decide is which color you want your rocket to be.

2020 Suzuki Boulevard C50T
Ready for a highway run? With the Suzuki Boulevard C50T, you’ll find yourself equally at home on the boulevard or the interstate. Its fuel-injected, 50 cubic inch, V-twin engine delivers abundant torque and is engineered for comfort. Its bold styling stands out in a crowd, while a long list of features make it ideal for comfortable long-distance cruising. Tour-ready features include a spacious riding position, aerodynamic windshield, custom-made leather-look saddlebags with studs, dual seats with studs, and a studded backrest designed for passenger comfort.
Features may include:
Climb aboard a true classic. Kick back and enjoy the timeless style that made riding synonymous with freedom. It’s all about the laid-back stance, broad saddle, and that irresistible rumble that only a cruiser can provide.
ENGINE
Narrow, 805cc, fuel injected, liquid-cooled, SOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder, 45-degree, V-twin engine is tuned for exceptional low rpm torque.
Sculpted engine features polished aluminum and chrome covers that complement the visually striking cylinders with symmetrical cooling fins.
Offset crankpins yield optimally balanced firing intervals and create a signature V-twin rumble.
Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) electronic fuel-injection system maintains optimum air velocity in the intake tract for smooth low- to mid-rpm throttle response.
CHASSIS
Strong, double-cradle steel frame supports a chassis ready for cruising or a full-on tour.
The Boulevard's styling incorporates timeless visual statements from American cruiser heritage: rich paintwork, glittering chrome, and deep front and rear fenders with sculpted ends.
The easily removable, height-adjustable windshield provides full wind protection with classic styling that includes a unique chrome garnish with Boulevard emblems.
Large-capacity, leather-texture saddlebags with Boulevard emblems and convenient twist-lock fasteners provide plenty of storage capacity.
ADDITIONAL
A variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories for Boulevard owners are available, including a large selection of Suzuki logo apparel.
12-month limited warranty. Longer coverage periods with other benefits are available through Suzuki Extended Protection (SEP).

This bike has an interesting history. It came to me from the original owner who bought it new in late 2005. The bike was used as a college commuter and had a proclivity for being backed into. The bike was never crashed when riding, but was tipped over several times in parking lots by cars running into it.

The front upper fairing/headlight is long gone, as is the original instrument cluster. I sourced a replacement cluster that says 50k miles, but the bike doesn't have anywhere near that, as it had its original tires on it when I started its reanimation.

I've been through every system on the bike and restored what needed attention. I was a Kawasaki dealer technician once upon a time and am quite familiar with these bikes. The following work has been performed:

-Carburetors removed, cleaned, and rebuilt with new parts
-Fuel tank removed and cleaned, petcock replaced
-Brand new Dunlop GPR300 tires front and rear
-Brake fluid flushed front and rear
-New 7"" H4 headlight installed with integrated front LED turn signals
-Low clip-on handlebars installed
-New battery

This bike starts, runs, and rides very well. It's a great way to get on two wheels for very little money and would be a great commuter.

Clean title in hand. No trades or lowball offers.

Comments for this 2017 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber:
2017 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber
Moto Guzzi interprets the legendary Bobber style, essential and aggressive: the chrome-plating leaves room for matte tones; the bobbed seat shows the mudguard; and the high-walled tires underline the grit of a true Bobber. The 850cc 90 degree transverse V-twin, cardan transmission and steel frame display the essence of Moto Guzzi in a Bobber version. The quality metal mudguards provide room for the imposing tires that deserve display with pride. The steel tank is painted in a dark matte color, enlivened by checkered graphics that underlines the sporty spirit of V9 Bobber. To ride in total safety, ABS and traction control come standard.
What is meant by authenticity? It means knowing how to live according to what we really are and want without being influenced by what everyone else does.
Anchored to the road and in full control, stability and safety. V9 Bobber puts a wide rear tire and a formidable 130/90 front tire on the pavement.
Features may include:
DUAL-CHANNEL ABS
2 ADJUSTMENT TRACTION CONTROL (MGCT)
METAL FRONT AND REAR MUDGUARD
USB SOCKET
IMMOBILIZER
150 MM REAR TIRE
ALUMINUM SIDE FAIRINGS

Due to life changes/situations my motorcycle has not been ridden since 2014. However, it has been stored indoor for those years. It is a solid and reliable bike, however, work needs to be done as it does not currently run. Needs a battery and work on the fuel system due to the length of time it has sat. I do not have the time at the moment to do the work needed.

Blue Book value is roughly $4,500 and I would like to see $2,500 for it due to its condition and mileage. But, I also know some time and resources will be needed to get it on the road. In short, I am open to some negotiating...

2016 Indian Motorcycles Chief Classic
PURE UNCOMPROMISING STYLE
Abundant power. Restless innovation. And unmistakable style. The stripped down essence of an iconic marque.
Stripped down until all that's left is an irresistible urge to ride. Take it all in, and you'll see a front end that drips with chrome and a light-up headress on the deeply valanced front fender leading the way. There's always somebody who wants to get a better look at the Classic's beautiful curves.

2015 Honda CBR500R
Middleweight. Never Middle Of The Pack.
Honda boldly redefines the middleweight class and infuses a whole new level of excitement for sport riders in search of superior value, along with great fun.
The CBR 500R delivers plenty of performance to sport riders, with its thoroughly modern, torquey 471cc P-twin DOHC engine wrapped in a great-handling chassis and featuring a full fairing spawned from Honda's much-acclaimed CBR 600RR and CBR 1000RR sportbikes.
The CBR 500R features a full bodywork cowl and a 31-inch seat height. It's an excellent choice for riders ready to move up a displacement class, or for any rider who's looking for a light, sporting, do-it-all street machine.Features May Include:
Enough Engine For Everything
Choosing a 500 isn't a compromise, especially when it's a powerplant with as much development behind it as Honda's parallel twins. Liquid-cooling, double overhead cams and bulletproof reliability make this a great all-around powerplant for any kind of riding you have in mind.
Sporting Heritage
The CBR 500R offers a riding position that's a touch more sporty, but not too aggressive, whether you're commuting or carving the canyons.
Practicality was never so much fun.
Its combination of lightweight and rider-friendly engine makes the CBR 500R a great choice for commuting, weekend rides, or just getting out and having fun. Plus, its lower seat height makes it easier to get your feet on the ground when you stop.
Accessorize Your Style
The CBR 500R has a full line of available Honda Genuine Accessories including a sport screen, color-matched passenger seat cowl, and carbon-look accents.

2014 Yamaha FZ6R
TIME TO RIDE!
The FZR6R offers features that make it easy for riders to get started: a low seat height, grips that reach back to you, and a torquey, 600cc engine you won't out grow anytime soon. Add a beautiful diamond-steel frame that sleek fairing, an R6-style exhaust and a price that makes it way more affordable than it looks, and it all adds up to the ultimate first sportbike.

Key Features May Include:

A rider in the market for an entry level or commuter 600cc bike doesn't have to compromise performance or style to get value. The FZ6R is a great combination of performance, handling, and exciting sport bike style, but also with a low seat height that's both adjustable to fit a wider variety of riders and also narrower where it counts to make it even easier to put both feet on the ground.

The engine delivers smooth power just the way today's rider needs it, brisk acceleration with plenty of torque that makes it a pleasure to get around town, with lots in reserve for when you want more. This is certainly not a no frills motor. Its derived from the FZ6 motor, fuel injected and tuned for outstanding low to mid engine performance.

Even if your primary goal is commuting to school or work, you want to be able to get out and have fun riding some twisty back roads. The FZ6R is ready to put a grin on your face! The diamond-shaped frame, made of high-tensile steel pipes using the engine as a structural member of the chassis, becomes the foundation for handling performance. It's designed to provide the right rigidity balance to contribute to smooth cornering performance.

When it comes to putting power to the pavement, the FZ6R uses nothing less than quality radial tires, 120/70R-inch front and 160/60R 17-inch rear. And this bikes excellent stopping performance is due to the dual 298mm front discs and 245mm rear disc, both with comfortable-to-use controls.

The fuel-injected engine in the FZ6R has been designed to meet the demands of today's motorcyclist. This engine optimizes the entire flow from the intake of the fuel-air mixture to combustion and exhaust. Even though it shares both bore and stroke dimensions with the FZ6, the cylinder head, crankcase, intake and exhaust system, as well as the clutch and shifter, were completely redesigned for the FZ6R, creating a power unit with an entirely different character.

The 600cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke in-line 4-cylinder engine is ready to respond with smooth, linear performance when the rider twists the throttle. Maximum output is achieved at a spirited 10,000 rpm and maximum torque is obtained at 8,500 rpm. Bottom line: Its outstanding torquey low to mid rpm engine performance is just right for someone who enjoys commuting to work or school or riding the canyons on the weekends.

With its exciting sport bike looks, onlookers will know this isn't just another middleweight bike. There's no mistaking Yamaha's high-performance heritage in the FZ6R.

The seat has separate front and rear sections, and the rider's seat features an innovative height adjustment mechanism. The seat can be set 20mm just over 3/4 of an inch higher for taller riders, a change that can make a big difference on an all-day ride.

The handlebar position can be adjusted 20mm forward by rotating the handlebar clamps to fine-tune rider comfort.

Have owned for 5 years or so. Only 37,000 miles. 88 cu in (1,450 cc). Great cruiser and I will miss it. New rear tire, new plugs and wires last spring. Power commander. Fishtail pipes. Fresh oil changes as well. Runs great with no major mechanical issues. Needs nothing at the moment. Tags are good until 7/2024. Lots of nice aftermarket parts. Even has cd player and cup holders.

Cons:
Totaled/Reconstructed title from previous owner. Laydown at slow speed, and just a few cosmetic blemishes from that.

Throws a P1353 or P1356 code (cylinder misfire) every once in a while, but it clears right away. Doesn't affect performance at all. Common for these bikes, and you wouldn't even know it except for the light.

That's about it.

2020 BMW F850GS Adventure Lowered + Dynamic ESA & Loaded GSA ADV,https://salem.craigslist.org/mcy/d/salem-2020-bmw-f850gs-adventure-lowered/7577954807.html,7577954807.0,"02/02/2023, 15:43:47","$19,995","Quick look:

BMW Financial clean title lien
HyperPro progressive springs + Dynamic ESA!
Factory warranty transferrable through June 6, 2023
Cosmetically imperfect with scratches
ALL available packages
Newer BMW battery
20+ upgrades
Garaged

HyperPro progressive suspension lowers the center of gravity by 1"" to improve ground reach for greater control in loose and uneven terrain, complemented by the admirable dynamic ESA system. This pairing is not available from BMW Motorrad. Mechanically excellent and only cosmetically imperfect with scrapes on the plastic fairings and right engine case--all pictured. I've ridden varied terrain and gone down only at low speed, which the GS easily handles. This adventure bike is ready to go wherever you want, however far.

Garaged and well cared for by a former military aircraft mechanic. All factory packages are present: Premium, Touring, Dynamic (unlocks Enduro Pro Ride mode), and Exclusive Trim with a center stand. The BMW battery was replaced in May 2022 and is maintained by the included BMW Motorrad intelligent tender.

The best aspect is a hard-to-find combination of BMW's lean-angle sensitive Dynamic Electronic Suspension Adjustment (ESA) system paired with high-quality HyperPro progressive springs front and rear that mechanically lower the bike. BMW does not sell lowered models with the Dynamic ESA option--it's one or the other. Motorrad dealers will charge ~$3k for this suspension work. Now, you can have firm footing across all height-adjusting ride modes, preload settings, and shock valving profiles.

I meticulously performed the suspension work. This setup preserves performance and reduces standover height by 25mm or 0.98"". The Wunderlich AktivKomfort seat contributes most of the 2.5"" total standover height reduction. Confidently enjoy the GS wherever adventure leads you!

Features and upgrades:

Dunlop Trailmax Mission 50/50 tubeless tires with aramid fibers (Kevlar)
Mosko Moto Backcountry 70L (35L per bag) rugged all-weather pannier saddle bag system
BMW aluminum top case with optional passenger backrest padding
Givi S250 lockable toolbox adapted for a custom fit behind the pannier frame opposite exhaust to balance weight
Rizoma high-viz LED front turn signals
Rizoma high-viz LED rear turn signals
Doubletake foldable, durable off-road mirrors with excellent visibility
Dominator stainless exhaust linkage replaces the large and heavy catalytic diffuser
Black Dog powder-coated skid plate
Black Dog powder-coated center stand plate
Machine Art Moto ABS hand & lever guards with removable wind deflectors for hot weather
Wunderlich AktivKomfort dual-density low-profile comfort seat also great for passengers
Wunderlich double adjustment rugged folding brake and clutch levers with magnetic lock
Wunderlich flip-up headlight guard for easy cleaning of polycarbonate shield and LED headlight lens
Wunderlich side stand enlargement aluminum plate
Pivot Pegz for excellent control and standing comfort
GS-911 onboard WiFi diagnostics & service module
Adjustable mid-height windshield (not miniature like a Rallye or too high)
Dash navigation with the BMW Connected ride app
Speedo Angels high clarity LCD protection
QuadLock adjustable mount
Electronic cruise control
Multi-level heated grips

You'll also get the costly BMW Motorrad digital factory service manual for F Models K8x, and the latest BMW lithium-ion compatible intelligent battery tender to keep the newer battery in good shape.

BMW Financial holds the title security interest/lien. If financing, your bank will pay BMW Financial directly. If paying with cash (in-person), bank check, money order, Zelle, or USAA account transfer, we'll sign an Oregon bill of sale confirming the legal transfer of ownership. I will pay the loan's balance, provide confirmation, and the title will be issued to you.

I'm ready to coordinate freight pickup for out-of-state buyers. My R9T was sold to a person in Denver, and the process was straightforward. Non-financed payments (apart from cash) must clear before shipping.

Thanks for looking.

Located in West Salem, Oregon
A true 50/50 machine, this bike performs well in sand, gravel, rocks, tarmac, rutted highways, wide-open highways, cross-winds, forest roads, whatever you throw at it. With the Ohlins rear shock, the K60s and the custom seat you can blast down I-5 for hours at 80 mph hauling your camping gear, cross the mountains, head down a trail for the afternoon and do it all again day after day. I average a consistent 58mpg with premium fuel. The ABS can be switched off at the trailhead. The seat is a custom seat by Mr. Eds Moto in Albany. It's extremely comfortable for day-long rides; lightyears better than the stock seat. The cover is a Seat Concepts cover. The overall height is the same as the stock seat.

Notable items:
Ohlins adjustable rear shock. Two springs included and spring adjuster tool
Rotopax 1 gallon canister. The gas light will come on around that 110 mile mark. Some people complain about the range of the X series, but 140 miles is a perfectly fine range. And with the Rotopax, expect closer to 180.
Booster Plug. It's unplugged, but wired and ready to go if you prefer it. It's known to solve some idle surging issues, but I've never needed it.
KTM 27mm enclosed axle nuts. The included factory nuts are 26mm, but it is difficult to find a 26mm wrench.
Grade 5 titanium handlebar mount bolts
Hepco-Becker center stand
SW-Motech engine guard

As far as cosmetic issues, you will notice scrapes on the white and black plastic throughout. One of the previous owners cut a section of the chain guard because the Rotopax could contact it. Also, a common modification is to drill holes in the shift lever because it could damage the shift shaft when the lever doesn't bend on certain falls.

I'm happy to deliver the bike locally, work with shippers, fly-n-riders, whatever transaction you prefer.

It has the 212cc engine, telescoping front forks and headlight. I have owned it a couple years so technically I guess it isn't brand new. It was shipped to me boxed and crated. I assembled it carefully and correctly, fired the engine and then put it in the garage. It has been ridden from the garage to the storage shed behind the garage and thats it. I am 75 and and a little too old for it. This little bike has lots of power and will go off road very well. It is suitable for adults [probably best no more than 180lbs]. Kids love these little powerhouses but I am not sure of a recommended age for kids [probably on line somewhere]. There are lots of videos on these great little bikes.

2022 KTM 890 Duke
THE SCALPEL
The KTM 890 DUKE redefines the word 'sharp' by adding an extra edge. Powered by an 889 cc parallel-twin nestled into one of the lightest and most compact chassis around, the KTM 890 DUKE boasts the agility you'd expect from a 600 cc, but with the meaty punch of a bigger twin. It doesn't rewrite the mid-sized naked bike rule book. It obliterates it.
Features may include:ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
The LC8c engine shares a great deal of its ferocity with the ultra-sharp KTM 890 DUKE R. Boasting a hard-hitting 115 Hp and 92 Nm, this compact, liquid-cooled 8 valve powerplant, is the most compact twin in class punching way above its weight in terms of output. CHASSIS
Frame
The incredible handling characteristics of the KTM 890 DUKE are founded on the dynamic, loadbearing design of the tubular chassis. Engineers had one goal in mind, and that was to keep the chassis as rigid and compact as possible for sharper turn-in and greater lean angles, allowing it to slice through the turns with extreme responsiveness.ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
A tapered aluminum, 760 mm wide handlebar puts you in full control. It's adjustable, with 4 positions on the triple clamp and can be rotated in three further positions for that perfect riding position.BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
TFT dashboard
Like all pilots, DUKE riders need easy access to information. In that regard, the KTM 890 DUKE features an intuitive multicolor, light variable TFT dashboard. Best of all, as the revs rise, the display bars change color to indicate when to shift, either spurring you on or warning you that the engine is too still cold for flat-out backroad attacks. SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Rider Aids
The KTM 890 DUKE has adopted a vast swathe of rider aids found on the blistering KTM 890 DUKE R, and further refined them to be more user and road-friendly, without hindering any performance.

The CSC RX3 Adventure motorcycle is perfect for real-world riding, including adventure touring, off-road excursions, sightseeing, or commuting to work economically. The RX3 is equipped with a proven and smooth 250cc, 4-valve, overhead cam, counter-balanced engine. The engine is water-cooled and equipped with Delphi fuel injection and electric start. For maximum performance the bike features a six-speed transmission.

The RX3 engine has a proven record of economy and durability around the world. The engine is also specifically designed to be low-maintenance. This same engine is a best-seller in Central America (where motorcycle sales far exceed that of the U.S. annually.) The RX3 has competed and been proven in off-road rallies in Eastern Europe. This same dependable RX3 counter-balanced engine is also found in the RC3 factory Moto GP racing bike that has competed since 1999 and won the 2002 Motorcycle Endurance World Championship.

The CSC RX3 Adventure is outfitted with an equipment package that includes 80/20 dual sport tires on steel rims, a tall windscreen, adjustable front and rear suspension, Black rear panniers and top case, front and rear guards, steel engine skid plate, and much more that cost hundreds more on other bikes. Other adventure motorcycles force you to buy countless upgrades, but the RX3 includes a comfortable touring seat, passenger seat and foot pegs, LED turn signals and tail light, ABS brakes, a full digital dash with speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, gear indicator, neutral light, and clock plus an analog tachometer. These extra-cost options are all STANDARD equipment on the RX3.

But the CSC RX3 value continues with anodized front forks, wide steel foot pegs with removable rubber inserts, a stainless-steel exhaust, a 4.2-gallon gas tank with locking gas cap, a 300-watt alternator for accessories, 12 Volt charger , USB port and handlebar switches for these electrical accessories. You will pay hundreds more to add any of these options to any other adventure motorcycle — if even possible - but ALL these features are STANDARD on the CSC RX3!

Comments for this 2018 BMW R NineT Urban G S:
2018 BMW R NineT Urban G/S
Eye-catching. Powerful. Air-cooled.
Enjoy the confident feel of a boxer with an upright and relaxed riding position, coupled with modern technology. Choose from countless customizing options to integrate your own unique ideas. The R nineT Urban G/S makes a clear statement: It pays tribute to the early days of BMW Motorrad's G/S success story. Just one look and it's clear that the R nineT Urban G/S captures the off-road spirit of that era. At the same time, its riding characteristics make it a true member of today's R nineT family.
The source of inspiration: unmistakable.
The design of the R nineT Urban G/S is eye-catching. Distinctive stylistic elements make it a powerful, robust bike that pays tribute to the original G/S design: the 19-inch front wheel, the telescopic fork with the familiar bellows, the headlamp mask with the windscreen and the raised front-wheel cover define the front of the bike. The profile is defined by a pronounced horizontal line. White body elements and the narrow, slightly longer red seat invoke the spirit of the legendary R 80 G/S from 1980. The black engine and frame highlight this effect. The new classic round instruments also show that the Urban G/S is part of the R nineT family. The R nineT Urban G/S also excels on everything from unpaved paths to gravel roads. The optional knobby off-road tires on spoked wheels, the Enduro foot pegs, the bolted-on heat shield and the steel footbrake lever emphasize the bike's purpose, both functionally and visually.

Technology for pure riding fun.
The R nineT Urban G/S is faithful to tradition with its looks, but the bike shows equal respect for the present with its modern technology. It features the proven engine and electrical system of the BMW R nineT. The Urban G/S also meets the current EU-4 emission standard. The powerful air-cooled, two-cylinder boxer engine features a capacity of 1170 cc and 110 hp (81 kW) of output for a highly dynamic power delivery, even at low speeds. All for a light and modern riding experience. The standard ABS and optional ASC Automatic Stability Control help confidence in a range of riding conditions. One more direct visual reference to the enduro roots of the G/S is the raised exhaust system made of brushed stainless steel.
Upright and majestic.
The balanced ergonomic triangle of the Urban G/S keeps you agile and confident on the road: The slightly higher handlebar, the long seat surface and slightly deeper and wider rear mounted footrests make for a more relaxed and confident riding experience. The standard seat height of the series is 33.5. The optional lower seat height of 32.2 makes the R nineT Urban G/S a great fit for riders of almost all sizes.

Steering, handling and brakes were a major overhaul over the previous year’s R and non-R models. It was intended to give an owner a good track day mount by including the handling upgrades and a Lap Timer built into the Dash Menu.

At 382#’s dry, the bike’s rated 106 HP and low reciprocation drivetrain mass make for more fun than a barrel of Monkeys. This is a Hooligan’s bike and what a great street ride. The weight is not in the wrists, you can manage your weight through your feet. The upright sitting position will make for a longer day in the saddle then one with most of your weight being pushed into the handle bars.

Our particular bike has some nice Triumph Factory Options installed. There are Billet Bar End Mirrors along with Shortie Levers. A SC Project Slip-On Exhaust really accents the Triples Growl as RPM’s build along with a tinted Fly Screen added to the Fairing. Tires look to have about 1,000 miles on them.

Miles on this 2014 Triumph Street Triple 675R are 13,255 and the VIN# is SMTL03NE5ET624094. The selling price is $5,895.

Vehicle Comments:
The Honda VTX 1800, introduced in 2002 and produced until 2008, is a cruiser motorcycle that was available in various models and specifications. The VTX 1800 Spec 3 was one of the top-of-the-line models, and it had a number of features that made it stand out from other models in its class. Here are a few things that are considered among the best about the VTX 1800 Spec 3:

Engine: The VTX 1800 Spec 3 is powered by a liquid-cooled, 1795cc V-twin engine that is known for its smooth power delivery and low-end torque. The engine is also quite reliable and easy to maintain.

Power: With about 97 horsepower and over 100 lb-ft of torque, it had a lot of power for a cruiser.

Handling: The VTX 1800 Spec 3 has a long wheelbase and a relaxed riding position, which makes it a comfortable bike for long distance rides. The suspension is well balanced and it has a good weight distribution.

Build quality: The Honda VTX 1800 Spec 3 was known for its solid build quality and overall durability. Many of these bikes are still on the road today, a testament to the robustness of the design.

Style: The VTX1800 Spec 3 features a classic cruiser design that still looks good even today, and was available in various paint schemes.

Customizability: Honda VTX1800 Spec 3 is a popular platform for customization, which makes it a good option for those looking to personalize their ride.

It's worth noting that the specific features may vary from model year to model year of the VTX 1800. And as always, test riding a motorcycle is the best way to evaluate if it meets your needs and preferences.

2023 KTM 150 XC-W
Quite literally in a class of its own, the 2023 KTM 150 XC-W is an unlikely underdog in the world of enduro. Proudly featuring KTM's proven 2-stroke engine technology, supreme agility, and surprising power delivery, it helps elevate rider and machine to incredible new heights at all levels of competence. Light enough to be hauled up the hardest of trails, yet packing enough punch to hang on to the big boys, the KTM 150 XC-W commands respect.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Thanks to state-of-the-art engineering, innovative 2-stroke design, and revolutionary TPI fuel injection technology, the 150 cc 2-stroke powerplant is as surprising as it is effective. Delivering class-leading power throughout the entire rev range, the benefit to this compact, lightweight 2-stroke is down to its approachable rideability, making it a great option for those looking to delve into more extreme action, without the intimidation of a bigger 2-stroke.
Cylinder
The KTM 150 EXC cylinder has a bore of 58 mm and with refined port timings and the aid of a sophisticated power valve, provides really smooth and controllable power characteristics. For the EFI application the cylinder features two lateral domes which hold the fuel injectors that supply fuel to the rear transfer ports. The downstream injection guarantees excellent atomization of the fuel with the upstreaming air. Thus, the loss of unburnt fuel is minimal, resulting in less emissions, a more efficient combustion and reduced fuel consumption. A small tube in the back of the cylinder is connected with an intake pressure sensor, which supplies pressure data to the control unit. The cylinder features a power valve unit with a sophisticated mechanism for the lateral support exhaust ports. The exhaust port layout increases engine performance, while the upper contour of the exhaust port has been machined to ensure more accurate port timing. The new cylinder, with TPI technology, produces outstanding performance over the entire range with significantly increased torque compared to its predecessor.
CHASSIS
Frame
All KTM EXC models feature high-tech, lightweight Chromoly steel frames with race-derived geometry, optimal stiffness, and unparalleled feedback for the rider. This translates into a playful handling character, with remarkable stability at speed - not to mention FACTORY RACING style thanks to the striking orange coating. The subframe is made of extra-light and ultra-stable aluminum profiles, weighing less than 900 grams providing rear fender stability and durability in the event of a loop out.
Swingarm
The KTM 150 EXC features a one-piece aluminum swingarm, which is manufactured using a gravity die-cast production process. This results in exeptional strength at the lowest possible weight and the perfect flex behavior.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Handlebar
All KTM XC-W models are equipped with adjustable, high-strength aluminum tapered handlebars made by NEKEN. These can be mounted in four different positions. Standard with ODI vulcanized grip on the right side and a comfortable ODI lock-on grip on the left, your only worry is hanging on, and letting rip.
Footpegs
Self-cleaning footpegs prevent mud from clogging up the pegs, even when dragging them through deep ruts. This means your boots maintain their grip, and you maintain your focus on the trail.

Vehicle Comments:
The 2019 KTM RC 390 is a sporty and agile motorcycle, perfect for riders looking for a lightweight and nimble ride. This particular bike has low mileage. The RC 390 is powered by a 373cc single-cylinder engine that delivers smooth and responsive power, and it comes equipped with top-quality suspension and brakes for excellent handling and control. With its low mileage and high-quality components, this 2019 KTM RC 390 is a great choice for riders looking for a reliable and fun motorcycle.

2019 KTM RC 390
RACE INSPIRED
A sports bike in its purest form. Reduced to the essentials. Agile, fast, suitable for A2 driving licence and extremely sporty. Whether you are on country roads or the racetrack, the Moto3 genes are perceptible in every manoeuvre and convey a pure race feeling. The handling simply spectacular. The performance incredible. The power thrilling.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
The KTM RC 390's state-of-the-art, single-cylinder engine with twin overhead camshafts once again underlines KTM's development strength. Tame the streets with its punchy torque, race the curves with its smooth but impressive power.
CHASSIS
The orange painted frame of the RC 390 has been engineered to be one of the best performing chassis in the segment. It’s been built to reward riders with impressive agility, sporty feedback, comfortable ergonomics and dynamic handling. The increase of the steering head angle to 66.5 degrees resulted in a shorter trail, shorter wheelbase and increased ground clearance. All these modifications release the racer in the RC and guarantee quick, responsive and playful handling.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
The KTM RC provides a racing-inspired body position and freedom of movement while preserving the comfort needed for every day usage, for you and your pillion. Unsurpassed operability and large contact surfaces ensure optimum control and feel for maximum cornering fun all day long.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
The sporty bodywork, footpegs and control levers not only provide a unique supersport-inspired look, but also help the RC master extreme cornering with greater lean angles.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
Highly sophisticated electronics enhance the potency of this RC. The high-end technical features include ABS and a ride-by-wire throttle system, reflecting the high-quality standards.
ACCESSORIES & LUGGAGE
Whether cruising the streets or racing the tarmac, intensify your RC 390 to suit your personal preferences with KTM’s wide range of accessories for KTM motorcycles. All KTM PowerParts are developed specifically for their chosen machine, guaranteeing KTM riders only get parts that perfectly complement their ride and provide that important ‘factory fit’ straight from the dealer.

Vehicle Comments:
Starts easy sounds good! Lowering Link and a few more goodies such as break away levers.

2019 Honda® CRF250R
HOLESHOTS, PLUS.
The 250 motocross class just might be the most competitive in all of racing. If you give an inch on the track, there are 20 or 30 other guys waiting to eat your lunch and use you for traction. First lesson: Winning starts with the holeshot, and getting the holeshot is where Honda’s CRF250R excels. We gave it an all-new DOHC engine last year, and this year we’ve continued with upgrades and refinements. Lesson number two: Hold on to the lead once you’ve got it. On a 250 this can be tough, especially in the slower corners. No problem on a 2019 CRF250R—we’ve made specific improvements in power delivery to give you that critical edge in the tight stuff. The open-class guys can just point and shoot here, but on a 250 that’s where a race is won and lost, by inches. So use every advantage you have, because you know what? There’s going to be someone else on the starting line riding a 2019 CRF250R, and if you’re not, you’ll end up behind them.
Features may include:
HRC LAUNCH CONTROL
We’re talking about a special ECU here: push the button to select the mode, hold the throttle open, release the clutch, and the CRF250R will do the rest, launching you into the first turn with a big advantage. It turns your bike into a holeshot-seeking machine!
ELECTRIC START
The CRF250R is equipped with an effortless electric starter. Convenient and lightweight, it’s a huge deal if you need to restart a stalled bike in the heat of battle.
NEW DOUBLE-SPRAY INJECTOR SETTINGS
The CRF250R’s fuel-injection system sprays twice per intake cycle. That helps increase fuel atomization without adding the weight or complexity of a second injector. The better fuel atomization means more power in the midrange and on over rev—you’ll feel it the first time you race.
SHOWA SPRING FORK
The 49mm Showa fork features a conventional spring design that helps increase the CRF250R’s front-suspension precision, handling and feel. The 39mm piston diameter and 25mm rod diameter guarantee a plush feel and supple action.

2017 Suzuki GSX-R1000
It has been three decades, with more than a million editions sold, since the GSX-R line was born. And a decade and a half has elapsed since the first GSX-R1000 transformed the open sportbike class forever. Now, the 2017 GSX-R1000 is redefining what it means to be The King of Sportbikes. This motorcycle’s chassis forms the lightest, the most compact, the most aerodynamic and the best-handling GSX-R1000 ever. Cradled in the new aluminum frame is an all-new engine that uses an exclusive Variable Valve Train and Ride-by-Wire throttle bodies for a wide spread of power while delivering smooth and precise throttle response. Using an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) the GSX-R1000’s advanced electronics package includes selectable performance modes so the motorcycle enhances and fine tunes rider inputs. The six-axis IMU lets the GSX-R1000 recognize its position on the street or race track to help the rider achieve an extraordinary level of riding performance.
Up front, new style BREMBO T-drive brake rotors grasped by Monobloc calipers provide strong, controlled braking, while the precise and smooth SHOWA suspension keeps the sticky Bridgestone RS10 tires in touch with the road. All of this forward-looking motorcycle technology is covered in all-new, wind tunnel-developed bodywork that’s uniquely GSX-R. The King of Sportbikes is back, bow to the King. Available with optional ABS*. Colors TBA. *Depending on road surface conditions, such as wet, loose, or uneven roads, braking distance for an ABS-equipped vehicle may be longer than for a vehicle not equipped with ABS. ABS cannot prevent wheel skidding caused by braking while cornering. Please drive carefully and do not overly rely on ABS.
Features may include:

2021 Husqvarna® FE 350
The FE 350 is known for its versatility in all types of terrain. With a lightweight chassis and enhanced all-round performance, it possesses 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, while keeping the light and agile feel of a 250. Already a preferred choice for those wanting a perfect balance of weight and power, the motorcycle combines premium WP suspension, innovative electronics and comfortable ergonomics, along with a host of other innovative refinements that make the FE 350 second to none when the going gets tough.
Features may include:
ENGINE
When it comes to versatility, the DOHC 350 cc engine is second to none. By sharing much of its architecture with the 250 cc engine, the FE 350 delivers a fine balance between 450-rivaling power and lightweight 250 handling.
CYLINDER HEAD
The FE 350 features an advanced DOHC cylinder head layout meticulously engineered to deliver performance and reliability. Internally, the DOHC layout features polished camshafts and low-friction DLC coated finger followers. Together with the lightweight titanium valves - 36.3 mm intake and 29.1 mm exhaust - they aid in delivering optimal performance.
FRAME
The chromium molybdenum steel frame is expertly crafted using laser-cut, robot-welded, hydro-formed tubes, ensuring the highest level of precision and quality. The specifically crafted geometry utilises advanced longitudinal and torsional flex characteristics, for unparalleled rider feedback, energy absorption and exceptional straight-line stability. The cylinder head mountings are made of forged aluminium, improving handling and comfort. The premium blue powder coated frame features standard frame protectors, providing extra durability.
COMPOSITE CARBON FIBRE SUBFRAME
The carbon composite subframe is unique to Husqvarna Motorcycles and showcases advanced production technology and innovation. Using 70% polyamide and 30% carbon fibre, the 2-piece subframe has a total weight of just over 1 kg. With the help of computational dynamics, specific rigidity was engineered into the light and robust subframe, delivering outstanding handling and rider comfort.
WP XPLOR FRONT FORK
The WP XPLOR 48 front fork is designed specifically for enduro riding. Its open cartridge layout has a spring in each leg with split damping functions. Compression damping in the left leg and rebound damping in the right. Adjustment is via easy-to-access clickers (30 clicks) on the top of each fork leg. The standard preload adjusters allow for easier adjustment without the use of tools. The fork's mid-valve piston delivers consistent damping, while the setting allows the fork to operate higher in the stroke for exceptional rider feedback and bottoming resistance.
WP XACT REAR SHOCK
The WP XACT shock provides advanced damping characteristics to the range. The compact and lightweight shock features a pressure balance inside, ensuring consistent damping and superior rider comfort. Using the same linkage progression found in the Husqvarna Motocross range, the rear end sits low for improved control in extreme enduro conditions. The fully adjustable component delivers 300 mm rear wheel travel, as well as unrivalled traction, feeling and energy absorption.

Key Features:

Dual exhausts, custom-looking clear turn signals, lots of chrome, etc.—the V Star Custom represents tremendous cruiser bang for the buck.
Classic rigid-look rear end serves up 3.4 inches of rear wheel travel damped by a hidden preload-adjustable shock, offering up a great ride.

2015 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® Forty-Eight®
With a fat front tire and steel peanut tank, this low-slung urban brawler is ready to rip through any scene.
Features may include:
Fat Front Wheel
A beefy front end with a tall, fat MT90 tire gives the Forty-Eight® model a grounding visual equal to that of a 1950 Mercury. Custom rubber reminiscent of the lead-sled culture. A dominating presence up front that provides a smooth ride and solid handling.
Slammed Handlebar, Speedo and Under Mount Mirrors
The slammed black drag-style handlebar with speedo and under mount mirrors adds to the stripped down, minimal look of the Forty-Eight® motorcycle. Inspired by the way hot rod pioneers used to slam their rides, the drag style handlebar is an old-school garage feature that demands a forward, aggressive riding position.
Clean Rear End Styling
When the look is fast and smooth, details count and clutter doesn’t make the cut. We carefully crafted the rear end with retro-styled Stop-Turn-Tail lights and a side-mounted license plate to leave the fender surface clean and uncluttered for an authentically raw, custom look. And while the lamps may look old-school, it's their new-school engineering that keeps things clean, packing stop, turn and running beams into each bullet.
Evolution® Engine Heritage
The Evolution® engine—known in certain crowds as the Blockhead—was first bolted to the frame of a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle back in 1984. Born from legendary Shovelhead and Ironhead engines, the Evolution® engine broke new ground in displacement innovation while maintaining the hunger for power, durability and proven reliability that The Motor Company was built on.
Evolution® Engine Innovation
Air-cooled and durable as hell, the 1200cc Evolution® engine is yet another nod to the unwavering work ethic that drives advancements in motor technology at Harley-Davidson. Aluminum heads and cylinders lighten the load of the bike and improve air-cooling efficiency. Electronic fuel injection says goodbye to carburetors and boasts increased reliability and less routine maintenance. Bottom line: the rubber-mounted Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of the open road.
Foundation Brake System
Like riding itself, you can never go too far when it comes to improving a bike’s brakes. This is why we gave the brake system of each Sportster model a complete overhaul designed to improve performance, fit and finish. We increased the size of the brake rotors from 292mm to 300mm and added a more powerful, stylized front caliper with 34mm pistons and stylized rear caliper to match. Other system features include an improved all-aluminum integrated rear master cylinder with reservoir, all-aluminum front master cylinder with reduced friction and higher efficiency, and stainless steel braided lines. It all adds up to more confidence on the road and more power and predictability when you squeeze the brakes.
Low Seat & Slammed Suspension
The combination of a lowered front and rear suspension together with a low solo seat—just 26 inches high—provides confidence for riders of all sizes and experience. A responsive ride for whipping through town or busting out onto the interstate.
Michelin® Scorcher™ Tires
Michelin® Scorcher™ tires provide the superior performance, sensational grip, impressive durability and excellent handling expected on a race-bred bike. The exclusive deep-cut tread design improves grip and water evacuation capability. Grip performance and durability is also enhanced by the tire's rubber compounds, which use the latest generation of Michelin synthetic polymers.

2023 KTM 300 XC 300 Single-Cylinder 293.2

Price: $11,634.00
Description:

2023 KTM 300 XC
Maximum power at the least possible weight, amplified by low maintenance costs and smooth, linear power delivery - the 2023 KTM 300 XC is set to take the Open category back to school. Churning out massive power from an engine weighing only 52.6 lb, the KTM 300 XC sets the benchmark when it comes to power to weight ratios. Could the 2023 KTM 300 XC be the new Open Class president?
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
ENGINE
The new 300 cc 2-stroke powerhouse brings a new choice of weapon to the Open category and provides more choice for racers looking for maximum power at the least possible weight. Along with low maintenance costs and an overall engine weight of just 52.6 lb, the 2023 KTM 300 XC provides pure performance. Coupled together with advanced technical innovations, e-start, electronic fuel injection, and an electronic exhaust control, this is the new cross country kingpin.
CHASSIS
Frame
No matter how gnarly the trail is, you'll stay in complete control thanks to an all-new frame design that has not only been engineered for longitudinal rigidity, but also repositions rotating mass closer to the center of gravity. Thicker frame walls also improve reliability, flex characteristics and offer unmatched rider feel. A new shock mounting also provides improved anti-squat behavior for better traction out of corners, while the footpeg mounting position has moved inwards for less risk of hooking up on roots or rocks. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate.
POLYAMIDE-REINFORCED ALUMINIUM SUBFRAME
Weighing in at only 4 lb, the new 2-piece polyamide (60%) reinforced aluminum (40%) subframe provides impressive weight savings. With the help of computational dynamics, carefully calculated rigidity was engineered into the subframe, delivering outstanding handling and feedback, while remaining robust and reliable.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
48 mm air type WP XACT front fork with a split damping function provides all the confidence you need to attack the trails. New hydrostops in the fork legs improve bottoming-out resistance and account for less rebound when attacking big bumps while hauling across country. Redesigned fork protection rings also increase protection against dirt, making them as reliable as they are awesome.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
The 2023 KTM XC and XC-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high-grip orange seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. A handy grip pocket under the seat, just above the airbox, makes gripping the bike and lifting it much easier. In terms of graphics, the 2023 KTM XC and XC-F design takes its cue from the early 1990s when purple was one of KTM's predominant colors.

The 2023 KTM 300 XC features a map select switch as standard, allowing the racer to switch between 2 perceptible engine maps. Map 1 provides a linear, predictable power delivery, while Map 2 gives it the full beans with crisp, explosive power output.
START/STOP SWITCH
Starting the 2023 KTM 300 XC is as easy as pressing a button. Literally! Lighting quick starts come thanks to an ultra-lightweight 12.8V 2 Ah lithium ion battery placed under the rider's seat, close to the center of gravity, new high-quality stator and pickup and super robust design, and an all-new start/stop button deisgn.

Without missing a beat, he asked if I was interested in buying a bike or just there to waste his time. Ted became an instant hero, clear to the point and aware that wasted time cannot be retrieved. The next thirty years saw me take delivery of three bikes from Ted and his son Joe who took over when Ted retired. The two of them represented, to me, transparency and integrity in retail by example. Hopefully Automania LLC will be seen in a similar light when the time arrives.

Forty-four years on, Joe has closed the dealership. Everything was sold except Joe’s own personal bikes. If there is a reward for owning a new Motorcycle Franchise, it must be housed in owning what ever model you desire, knowing what you want added with the ability and means to do so.

And so Joe did. He uncrated a 2012 Suzuki GSX-R750L, did the pre-delivery service and started adding parts!

This is the list of After Market and Factory parts Joe added to the motorcycle, all “dealer installed”. As a bonus of sorts, all of the stock parts were boxed and saved, now coming with the bike for it’s next owner.

1. 2015 Blue Fairing Cowls, Lt & Rt
2. 2015 Fuel tank Graphics
3. Rear passenger “Pillion” seat used for Cargo Bag
4. 2015 GXX-R1000 Tank Graphics for rear Hugger
5. Large and small ring lock Tank Bags with Hardware
6. Adjustable Clutch & Brake Levers
7. Front Brake Lever Guard
8. Carbon Fiber “GSX-R” Tank Pad
9. Aluminum “GXS-R” Chain Guard
10. Vortex Rear Swing Arm Spools
11. Vortex Chassis Protectors (no cut)
12. Vortex Chassis Protector Blue Inserts
13. Saddlemans Gel Seat
14. Woodcraft Engine Case Guards
15. Woodcraft Engine Case Guard Blue Inserts
16. Yoshimura Alpha Exhaust System
17. Woodcraft Lower Swing Arm Chain Guard
18. Hotbodies Rear Hugger Fender
19. Phillip Lockhart Rear Fender Eliminator
20. Michelin Power RS tires with no miles

Regardless of the miles ridden, Joe changed the oils and filters every year. The bike sat on the showroom floor, sort of a trailer queen, managing to collect 3,373 miles since new.

A little head scratching later, BMW built more, a lot more and then the many variants that have followed.

The Pure version was intended by BMW to present an absolute essential platform form without many of “extras” that some customers demand, that others see as an interference with the true intent of the R9T design. There is no design by Decal and Badging found here. No gimmicks, no fluff, just a motorcycle with the basic electronic hardware most expect, ABS, Fuel Injection and Digital Instrumentation. If you are that rider, this is the bike, minimal fuss, minimal weight and a canvas to create by the owner.

And to our bike. Miles are 585 from new, sold new by Hansen’s BMW of Medford before the fire. Their long time, repeat customer was getting along and needed the maximum from the minimum that the Pure offers. Unfortunately, circumstances have intervened, the bike was rarely ridden and finally is being sold with almost no use. A first service was preformed at Hansen’s and it needs nothing except gas and to be ridden.

The selling price is $9,995. The VIN# is WB10J1305KZ732084 and miles are 535. Please come by and see at Automania LLC, 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, OR 97526. http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 Oregon Dealer DA1287.

2000 Indian Chief,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcy/d/grants-pass-2000-indian-chief/7585710883.html,7585710883,"02/03/2023, 18:54:43","$12,995","This 2000 Indian Chief was brought in by a couple who are now living in their RV touring across the country with family. The owner explained the he was an ex-Harley Tech who specialized in carburetors on the V-Twins and that he always love the Indians of the Gilroy era with their S&S Engines. And here we are, many years later.

The 2000 Indian Chief used the S&S Engine, an air-cooled 1442cc, V-Twin bolted to a 5-speed Transmission. Claimed power was 75 HP at 5200 rpm. It was not as heavy as most of the competition of the day at 650 pounds, but still it is not for the faint of heart at stop signs. Rumor has it that only 250 were built in 2000 making the bike a rare sight in a group of riders traveling down the road.

The bike was originally purchased out of a climate controlled storage unit where it had been kept after the New Jersey Indian Dealership closed. The Floridian buyer purchased the motorcycle with no miles on it and the few years that he had it, added just over 800 miles to the clock. Our consigner bought the bike with 812 miles and had it shipped. The oil was changed immediately and once again at 1,200 miles. It presents it’s self as completely stock with two very minor cosmetic defects. On the left side of the front fender at the bottom it has been touched up with matching paint. On the rear right sail panel covering the rear tire there is a tiny mark. The Odometer reads 2,022 miles. Mechanical inspections are welcome prior to purchase by a qualified, local shop.

The bike looks the part, in need of a long weekend with coffee and Semi-Chrome in a warm garage or living room to be in show room new in appearance. There is the stock windshield which is badly cracked plus the hardware for it. There is an owner’s manual also and some minor extra parts.

The VIN# is 5CDCNB510YG004184 and miles showing are 2,022. The selling price is $12,995.

2017 Harley Davidson FLTRXS / Road Glide Special,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2017-harley-davidson-fltrxs/7585710575.html,7585710575,"02/03/2023, 18:54:45","$14,995","This 2017 Harley Davidson FLTRXS / Road Glide Special marks the end of a riding career for our customer that saw him trading his last bikes in with over 90,000 miles each. With this bike, 60,000 miles in 5 years is a serious demonstration for his love of touring and motorcycling. The condition of the bike also demonstrates his seriousness with his no expense spared attitude towards upkeep and service. All service work has been completed by D&S Harley in Medford until their building burned in 2021 with S&D Custom Cycle of Grants Pass taking over on going and current maintenance.

2017 was the introduction of the 4 Valve Head Milwaukee Eight Engine. The Road Glide was pretty much unchanged other than this being the best equipped Touring Motorcycle Harley offered. The Fairing offers the best weather protection and comfort for their range of bikes along with the full compliment of Electronic Features and Cruise. It was designed to be ridden long distances, providing rider comfort and control.

At about 45,000 miles the spark plugs began fouling and the factory engine was diagnosed with worn valve guides. The owner took the bike to S&D Custom Cycle for repairs and a decision was made to rebuild the entire upper end, at the same time taking the 107 engine and making it a “114”, at cost of $6,700. See the attached receipts for recent service work and the conversion details.

The bike is cosmetically flawless and with a standout presence in Velocity Red Sunglo. The stock Mufflers and other stock items are included with the bike as well as the owner’s manual and second Key Fob.

Miles are 60,092 and the VIN# is 1HD1KTC17HB659986. The selling price is $14,995. For other interesting bikes and collectable vehicles, visit our web site http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 or come by and see us at 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97526. Oregon Dealer DA1287.

2016 Harley Davidson SuperLow 1200T,https://medford.craigslist.org/mcd/d/grants-pass-2016-harley-davidson/7585710445.html,7585710445,"02/03/2023, 18:54:46","$8,495","When most motorcyclist talk about a touring bike, the exaggerated vision of “large” comes immediately to mind. Tall and heavy, intimidating and hard to maintain control over. Despite the general conceptions, there are exceptions to the rule and the Sportster SuperLow 1200T stands out, providing comfort, storage, style and a 26.1 inch seat height.

Harley “Baggers” normally weigh 800-900 pounds and more, 300-400 pounds more than the 1200T. With a low center of gravity and without the normal Harley “baggage”, the 1200T is easy to maneuver even at low speeds by most. It is not intimidating in it’s power delivery or it’s braking but does both well.

Harley took the 1200 Sportster and dressed it for Touring. They gave it mid-mounted foot controls, extra wide foot pegs and that 26.1 inch seat height. Lockable, Leather covered, weather resistant Saddle Bags are no wider than the handle bars so you do not have to worry about dragging them against anything you have already have passed. The Handle Bars have a nice reach to them without turning you into a parachute going down the road. There is a quick detach Windshield and a 4.5 Gallon Fuel tank that should be good for almost 200 miles at 48mpg. The transmission is a 5-Speed and the motor is Fuel Injected.

Our bike is cosmetically beautiful in its Vivid Black Paint with Silver Pin Stripping. Tires look to be at least 80% and the bike appears to need nothing but a new direction and fuel to go. If you want to ride and tour but not fight with a bike, this will be a great choice.

The selling price is $8,495, miles are 4,387. The VIN# is 1HD1LL318GC441738. For other interesting bikes and collectable vehicles, visit our web site http://www.automaniagp.com 541 479 8888 or come by and see us at 895 SE Gladiola Drive, Grants Pass, Oregon, 97526. Oregon Dealer DA1287.

SUPER CLEAN BIKE, LOTS OF EXTRAS!
2018 Yamaha YZ450F
YOU AND YOUR BIKE - CONNECTED AS ONE.
All-New from the ground up, the YZ450F incorporates electric start, exclusive smartphone app power tuner, new engine, new frame, new slim styling and revised settings to the already industry-best suspension.
Features may include:
Engine
Revised Engine Design
For 2018, the distinct rearward-slanted cylinder design complete with rear exhaust and forward-mounted intake system has been completely updated for 2018. The all-new cylinder head is lighter and is now angled more vertically, to work with the updated frame, for optimized front weight distribution. Inside, the engine features a longer, straighter intake tract, more aggressive cam profiles, a new crankshaft, a stronger, higher-compression box bridge piston design with DLC-coated piston pin, and more. Together, these updates give the rider an ideal balance of open-class power with exceptional controllability.
New Power Tuner App
Breaking new ground in the industry again Yamaha introduces the new Power Tuner app, which brings the power of the GYTR Power Tuner to your iOS or Android device. Using WiFi to connect to the bike's onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.
New Electric Starter System
The 2018 YZ450F now features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.
Chassis/Suspension
New Aluminum Frame
The 2018 YZ450F compact frame is completely new to further refine the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Larger upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and all-new engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.
New Compact Body and Seat Design
The new YZ450F features new bodywork from tip to tail, including a new compact fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the new body design is narrow for more comfortable knee grip and feeling of control, and the seat is updated to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.
Class-Leading Suspension
Industry-leading, fully adjustable KYB coil spring-type fork with speed sensitive damping provides exceptional balance between handling and bump absorption, for race-winning handling performance. The linkage type rear suspension features a KYB shock with revised damping characteristics to match the revised chassis. 2018 features updated internal valving for more controlled damping characteristics.
Additional Features
Adjustable Handlebar Mounts
The 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the handlebar itself is lighter to centralize overall mass.
Embedded Graphics
Yamaha's unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage, with all new styling for 2018.
Race Winning Details
The YZ450F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8 aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.

WHERE R WORLD MEETS YOURS

Features may include:
TOP FEATURES
Torquey CP2 Powerplant
Yamaha's proven 689cc liquid-cooled, inline 2-cylinder DOHC fuel-injected CP2 engine delivers excellent power and performance throughout the rpm range for an exhilarating ride and a true supersport experience. Its 270-degree crankshaft delivers linear torque for exciting acceleration and limited vibration.
All-New A&S Clutch
A first for Yamaha's CP2 platform, the all-new Assist and Slipper clutch reduces clutch lever force while providing seamless downshifts and a controlled feeling over the bike's engine braking. This helps make the supersport riding experience more accessible to more riders. For fast and smooth upshifts, an optional Quick Shift System (QSS) is also available on the YZF-R7.
