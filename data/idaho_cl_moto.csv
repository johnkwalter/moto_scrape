Only 408 miles!
Like new showroom condition.
Only 500 of these were produced worldwide with only 80 or so making it to the U.S.
KTM's are known for being rather tall and hard for many riders to feel comfortable on. This Rally would be perfect for a person that has struggled with tall bikes.
This KTM has the sought after Cone Valve suspension ( $6,500 upgrade ) that has been lowered 1 3/4"" by Solid Performance.
The setup performs extremely well off road with professional tuning and valving.
Set up for a 185lb rider. I rode it on Sunday in the boise front. I'm 165lbs without gear and the suspension worked flawlessly thru the woops on trail 4 and gravel roads.
Other than my ride on Sunday I do not believe this bike has ever been offroad.
Perfect for a rider that is 5' 6"" - 5' 10""
First service has been performed so you don't have to do anything but ride it for the next 8500 miles.
I suggest checking the air filter after every ride in the dirt.
Extras include a lower Seat Concepts seat bar risers and a Billet case guard. Has quick shift + and Rally Mode installed. Otherwise the bike is stock.
There is a scuff on the left side tank guard from the previous owner. Looks like a parking lot tip over.
No other scuffs or scrapes on the bike.
This bike will not disappoint!

$21,500 OBO

Description
The Road King® is where stripped-down, nostalgic style meets the performance and versatility of a modern Harley-Davidson® touring machine. The Hiawatha headlamp and nacelle were born in the ‘60s, when chrome ruled the streets. But the power of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 engine brings it all into the here and now in a hurry. The Showa® dual-bending valve front suspension and rear emulsion shocks put you in control for a plush ride. With cast aluminum Impeller wheels and one-touch opening saddlebags, this is the timeless classic built for today.

2022 KTM 200 Duke
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT
Thanks to an ultra-compact single-cylinder 4-stroke power plant and a lightweight tubular chassis, the KTM 200 DUKE packs a mighty punch. An updated predatory design proudly displays its BEAST-inspired DNA and shouts DUKE. Make no mistake - the KTM 200 DUKE is an out-and-out street prowling brawler.
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
Engine
Powered by a powerful single-cylinder engine, the KTM 200 DUKE not only delivers intoxicating acceleration but also everyday rideability. Boasting 19 kW (26 hp), it's the most powerful 4-stroke option in its class. Thanks to an updated airbox and exhaust, it meets the highest emission and noise standards, while providing maximum performance.
CHASSIS
Upside-down fork
The KTM 200 DUKE comes with ultra-lightweight, high-performance upside-down WP forks as standard. Using the latest technology, these forks not only perform flawlessly when pushed to the limit, but also allow riders to cruise comfortably on longer stretches of tarmac.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
Seats
The two-part seat offers first class sport riding ergonomics with maximum support for both rider and pillion.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
Design
There's no denying the KTM 200 DUKE is 100% DUKE. Its aggressive-looking headlight, READY TO RACE stance and sharp lines make it a formidable presence on any street.
SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS
ABS
Single channel BOSCH ABS comes as standard on the KTM 200 DUKE. This means you can ride assured knowing that should you have to brake hard and suddenly - the DUKE has your back.

Description
The Street Glide® is a bagger with street-wise soul, such as stripped down trim and chrome, low suspension, and blackened, cropped wind deflector. Inspired by the street, the Street Glide is ready to roar with attitude. The innovative Harley-Davidson® Touring chassis is based on a single-spar, rigid backbone frame and a stout swingarm developed to withstand the demands of long-haul touring riders and today's powerful engines.

I picked up the bike through a deal a few years back, and bought all the parts to put it back on the street. It has sat ever since, and is a project that isnt going to get attention for a long time, so I figured I would post an ad seeing if there is anyone interested in picking it up. I am not in any hurry to sell, as it can continue to sit until I get to it. These bikes are only getting more rare, and I have only seen 1 of them on the road in the entire Treasure Valley.

I have purchase (nearly) all of the parts to put it back on the road (from KTMPartsPro in AZ @ $2000, Ebay and Local purchases of another $2500). All of the parts will be included, and with a realtively minor investment of your time, you will have an axe murdered, twin powered bike. Notable parts that remain 'to be furnished' are certain left side body panels, and headlight cowl (Brand new headlight assembly is included). There will be other odds and ends required as it is reassembled, however all major components to make it 'running and riding' are there. We can go through the parts boxes together.

The bike has an Akrapovik exhaust, fender/tail 'tidy' kit, and I have replaced the entire front end of the bike with new triple tree's and an OHLINS front suspension. I picked up the factory rebuilt front end from another racer along the way, so it has an amazing front end on it. (retains stock WP rear shock, which is awesome as is).

Ask questions. Salvage Title in hand. See pictures for contact information.

Description
The refined gloss-black finishes, modern edge and reinvigorated ride of the Heritage model take nostalgia ripping into a new place. It starts with the performance of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 or 114 engine and the re-invented Softail® frame and suspension. The ride will put a big smile on your face. On top of that, you get a look that drips with gangster-era style. And practical features like a windshield and hard saddlebags for light touring. Tradition is good, but it doesn’t mean sitting still. Available in 107 (1745cc) and 114 (1868cc) engine displacements.

Description
The Road King® is where stripped down, nostalgic style meets the performance and versatility of a modern Harley-Davidson® touring machine. The Hiawatha headlamp and nacelle were born in the 1960’s, when chrome ruled the streets. But the power of the all-new Milwaukee-Eight™ 107 engine brings it all into the here and now in a hurry. The all-new double bending valve front suspension and rear emulsion shocks put you in control for a plush ride. With cast aluminum Impeller wheels and one-touch opening saddlebags, this is the timeless classic built for today.

Nice Nice Nice - Low Hours -

2022 Husqvarna® FC 350
With the agility of a 250 and a 450-rivalling power-to-weight ratio, the FC 350 strikes a competitive balance between power and handling. This appeals to both professional and amateur riders alike, making for a more user-friendly riding experience in all conditions. It is this versatility, paired with intelligent traction and launch control, which makes the FC 350 one of the most multitalented motocrossers on the market.
For 2022 we upgraded the hydraulic clutch to an all new high-performance Brembo system for perfect modulation at all times. On top, striking new dark blue and white graphics stylishly adorn the Swedish inspired design.
Features may include:
ENGINE
Weighing in at only 27.2 kg (59.9 lb) and churning out serious power, the engine in the FC 350 is designed with performance as a priority. It is also one of the lightest engines in its class.
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
Clean, Swedish-inspired design and ergonomics are tailored to deliver exceptional comfort and control, enabling riders to perform at the highest level for extended periods of time. Adapted after countless hours of testing, the contact points are specifically positioned to allow seamless movement around the motorcycle.
MAP SWITCH
Optimized for easy operation, the map switch selects between two engine maps, operates launch control and activates a traction control feature. Traction control works by analyzing throttle input from the rider and the rate at which the RPM increases. If the RPM increases too quickly, the EMS will register a loss of grip and reduce the amount of power to the rear wheel ensuring maximum traction.
COOLING SYSTEM
Made using high-strength aluminium, the cooling system on the FC 350 features computational fluid dynamics to channel air through the radiators more efficiently. The cooling system is also integrated into the frame allowing improved cooling by channelling coolant through the frame while eliminating the need for additional hoses.

The icon you love to see and love to be seen on. Powered by a Milwaukee-Eight® 107 engine, the Street Glide® lives up to its name with a fully adjustable rear suspension and a responsive front end that let you hum smoothly along rolling highways and winding roads. Its hot-rod bagger style and iconic batwing fairing may have spawned a slew of imitators, but none can put you into the exhilaratingly focused headspace that the original can—especially with the optional Reflex™ Defensive Rider Systems and BOOM!™ Box GTS infotainment system.

Description
The 2014 Ultra Limited® is a premium touring bike full of authentic Harley-Davidson® grand American touring style. As part of Project RUSHMORE, it has been redesigned for 2014 and features a new twin-cooled high output Twin Cam 103™ engine with more low-end torque and passing power and is combined with a smooth-shifting Six-Speed Cruise Drive transmission for low rpm at highway speeds. There is more room and improved touring comfort for the passenger and the redesigned iconic batwing fairing reduces head buffeting. It features anti-lock brakes (ABS) with linked brakes for optimum braking regardless of road conditions and the new Boom™ Box Infotainment system provides the loudest, clearest sound and most intuitive operation ever on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Another feature of the bike is the motorcycle luggage capacity - the sleek new touring saddlebags and Tour Pak® provide more room for your gear and the new latches that can be operated with one hand for added convenience.

Description
Re-introduced in 2010, the Dyna® Wide Glide® motorcycle is all about attitude. Its tough, dark styling and retro feel, along with a retro price tag, give riders the confidence to sit low and stretch out. The Wide Glide® is raw and true to its roots with a chopped rear fender, black rims on 40-spoke laced wheels, a black tank console, “Tommy Gun” exhaust, beefy, raked-out forks and a swept back sissy bar. Throw in the old-school flame paint scheme and heads are sure to turn. The lowered suspension, internally-wired handlebar with 4-inch riser and forward foot controls offer an awesome ride and the sticker price provides amazing value.

Love this recently bought and only test ridden scooter but 50 mph is a bit much for a 76 year old with a few mobility issues so I need to find it a new home.

The 11-inch thickened run-flat off-road tires on full off-road suspension make the T88 durable and stable.

With the two 60V27AH large capacity lithium ion batteries it has a 40 to 60 mile range per charge and 3 speed/power modes. It has front and rear hydraulic disc brakes with spare brake pads, radical color changing LED lighting, dual ultra bright headlights, turn signals, electric horn, battery charge meter, speedometer and information display, removable seat post and wide seat with backrest, along with many more features. Folds up for easy transport and storage. Comes with dual chargers. This scooter takes off like a rocket and can go up the mountains or travel at highway speeds if you dare.

Here are some of the factory packages and accessories I added. Keep in mind I ordered back in March of last year and waited 3 months specifically for the Rally Style Package / color scheme.

-Rally package includes radiator guards and skid plates from factory and red, white and blue color scheme.
-Premium Package with all Ride Pro Modes (Dynamic Pro, Enduro Pro) and Keyless Start and quick shift up and down, hill start assist etc.
-Self-leveling suspension
-Heated grips and seats including the passenger seat
-Tourtech factory Black BMW hard cases. Both Sides and Top.
-Alt Rider clear headlight guard. (I prefer this over the metal versions as this protects from micro dust and rock.
-Factory GPS Navigator VI
-BMW Screen Protector since day 1. No screen micro scratches from wiping dust
-2022 is the year with ALL LED including blinkers from factory

This bike has only 760 miles! First 600 miles service was completed right at 623 miles. All records and factory documents will be provided. The bike has been under a cover in the garage. I fire it up once a month and take it around the block.

I am sure there are a lot out there that say this but this bike is truly in show room condition. Only rode this bike within the break-in parameters.

I have the Clean Idaho Title in hand. Anyone looking knows what this is and that you can basically have a brand new bike without the taxes, and dealer fees. Still well under factory warranty.

Let me know if you have any questions. I can work with you and your bank if needed.

Price is: $28,500

Send me an email with your contact info and I will respond immediately.

Thanks
Kelly

On top of that, you get a look that drips with gangster-era style. And practical features like a windshield and hard saddlebags for light touring. Tradition is good, but it doesn’t mean sitting still. Available in 107 (1745cc) and 114 (1868cc) engine displacements.

2018 BMW S 1000 RR Light WT/Lupin BL Met./Racing RD Dyn.Race Dyn.
An icon among superbikes.
The BMW S 1000 RR led to a revolution in the supersport motorcycle category right from the outset. In the time since, the bike continued to be developed, its tried and tested concept being honed even further and the latest technology added. Because of its impressive power curve and performance, one constant factor remains: it is still a trailblazer today. The S 1000 RR now comes with Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) as standard for even greater riding dynamics and road safety. It is a thoroughbred among sport bikes – whether on the road or on the racing circuit, and its innovative technology allows you to experience its performance with greater intensity and immediacy than ever.
The look of a winner. Or a high-performer. Or a fighter.
The RR is the epitome of a superbike. With its distinctive design features like the split face and asymmetrical front headlamps, it is instantly recognizable. The razor-sharp flyline gives it a look of extreme clarity, its contours and shapes complementing each other superbly. It radiates a love of straights and bends from the front to the rear and its hunger for high-level performance is plain to see. The RR shares its desire for pure acceleration and speed with you.
Winning statistics. Almighty performance.
The S 1000 RR’s liquid-cooled four-cylinder in-line engine is capable of 199 hp (146 kW) at 13,500 r.p.m. and a maximum torque of 83 lb-ft at 10,500 r.p.m. Yet even with this level of performance, the standard Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) ensures significantly greater safety.

Greater performance guaranteed.
Numerous details enable you to experience the performance of the S 1000 RR even more intensively and maintain an even better overview in all traffic situations. The three driving modes ""Rain"", ""Sport"" and ""Race"" ensure optimal coordination of electric throttle, ABS and ASC, even in differing conditions. The DTC Dynamic Traction Control and ABS, both of which now come as standard, ensure even greater safety too. Electric throttle enables the bike's immense power to be dispensed even more finely and directly.


With its exceptionally high resolution, the instrument panel provides a clear display of the selected settings along with road speed and engine speed. As a result you have an optimal overview of the RR's performance and of your settings at all times.

KEEPING THE IDEAL GRIP ON ADVENTURE.
Do you love extreme, long tours, even on bumpy roads? Do you enjoy stony paths or the wilderness? Whether it's asphalt, offroad, rocks or sand: the BMW R 1200 GS Adventure has the right answers to every challenge with its light, agile handling. A machine for all those who want to go to their limits and grow beyond them. The R 1200 GS is for the real adventure-lovers among you.
Choose your style.
Dust and mud may be your idea of style when it comes to the R 1200 GS Adventure. With two style packages, it’s easy to make the bike your own.
Design: Impressive presence.
The R 1200 GS Adventure is up for journeys and challenges of all types. With its powerful, robust and dynamic design, one look will tell you all you need to know about its character. Its wind, weather and engine guards lend it a highly distinctive look, with the bike's visual focus moved further to the front. The powerful splash guard on the R 1200 GS Adventure gives it a feisty appearance. It's ready to master any difficulties.
The R 1200 GS Adventure promises to always ride on – no matter what the challenge.
Reliable and powerful.
Regardless of where you're off to, the R 1200 GS Adventure is always a dynamic companion. Inspired by the legendary boxer torque of 92 lb-ft and 125 hp (92 kW) from a water-cooled twin-cylinder four-stroke engine. Its cooling concept rests on a combination of air and liquid cooling. Resulting in efficiency, high torque and reliability.
The wet clutch with anti-hopping function and the electric throttle make the R 1200 GS Adventure the ideal companion for adventure.

A lot of equipment. More riding fun.
An innovative highlight of the R 1200 GS and a ""must-have"" for the modern adventurer – BMW Motorrad Connectivity. This new optional equipment shows you everything about your motorcycle in a smart way and on a 6.5 inch TFT display. Connect your smartphone to your bike via Bluetooth and use functions via the multi-controller on the handlebars such as smartphone-based navigation, accept calls or even make calls, media functions like selecting and listening to music from your smartphone playlist, or use it even more vehicle information intuitively, without becoming too distracted from riding. For some functions, the BMW Motorrad Connected App is also required.
The practical equipment that comes as standard with the touring enduro caters for almost all your needs: two standard driving modes – ""Rain"" and ""Road"" – are available at the press of a button and offer your two entirely different, optimally coordinated driving styles.
Other modes are also available as Ride Modes Pro optional equipment. The corresponding Dynamic and Enduro riding modes ensure greater options on your quest for adventure. With a built in coding plug, the Dynamic riding mode becomes Dynamic Pro and Enduro becomes Enduro Pro.
The fuel tank capacity of 7.9 gallons gives you independence on your journey – for those very long stages. In addition, you have an on-board computer at your disposal: for the perfect journey organization and to display important data like doubled trip computer, average consumption and fuel range. Equally practical is the storage compartment above the tank. With this, any small items you have can be on hand at all times.

Had to order this motorcycle special and shipped to Boise. It turns heads everywhere you go.

It's a fantastic bike with just over 1000 miles on it. As soon as I bought the bike all my buddies sold theirs. Currently has the matching Indian passenger seat that was extremely difficult to locate. Had to call around and eventually found it at a dealership in Indiana.

Price may seem like it's close to retail but if you try buying one new you will see that Indian tacks on another 1500-2000 in setup and delivery fees so this is saving you quite a bit there and in taxes.

Bike is currently financed through Westmark Credit so it will be a bill of sale until I can get you the title.",,,gas,1000.0,green,clean,manual,,,,,,

2015 BMW S 1000 RR
Welcome to the new Planet Power.
The S 1000 RR revolutionized the supersports class when it first came out in 2009. Now - six years later - it steps up to the very same challenge. The S 1000 RR model year 2015 has been completely revised: BMW Motorrad engineers have entirely revised the bike's technology, design and fittings. The result: in its origins a genuine Double R, on the road a new supersports machine.
A facelift is not enough.
The RR is the epitome of a superbike - and that applies to its design, too. Now in its third generation, you can instantly see its increased power. The profile is razor-sharp and extremely clear, the volume of the contours and shapes perfectly balanced. From the rear to the front section, every trim component has been redesigned - including the headlamp element, where the symmetry has been given greater emphasis.
Increased output, reduced weight.
The new S 1000 RR has an output of 199 hp - 6 hp more than its predecessor. But it is not just its higher rated output that makes the Double R faster and more agile. Weighing in at 450 lbs incl. ABS and traction control, it is some 8.8 lbs lighter than the previous version. Furthermore, it has a newly designed exhaust system as well as a new engine set-up for increased torque, an improved output curve and many other optimized detail
Consistently revised down to the last detail.
In addition to major changes to design and performance, it is primarily the technical details which allow the S 1000 RR to take such a quantum leap forward. The electronic suspension components DDC and DTC have been given a new set-up, as has the entire suspension. This ensures greatly improved traction as well as better feedback to the rider. Optimized riding is enabled by such features as the Shift Assistant Pro (shifting up and down without clutch) and the e-gas throttle actuator for more precise and direct control. The rider operates these new features via the newly designed instrument panel which can be adapted to the specific type of use.
All in all: a new S 1000 RR.
In taking the S 1000 RR a step further for model year 2015, absolutely every component was re-assessed. The result is a superbike what will once again set the benchmark in its class - in other words a genuine Double R.

2022 BMW R 18 B Black Storm Metallic
RAW POWER – PURE SOUL
The R 18 B brings together full Boxer power with BMW Motorrad touring history and the emotional character of the R 18 family. The large front end featuring a fork-mounted fairing and low windscreen demonstrate a strong character. The 1802 cc of the black Big Boxer leaves no room for speculation. Still, it’s not all about displacement. The R 18 B goes significantly further. It’s made for customizing. Turn it into your unique bike and bring out the #SoulFuel.
Features may include:
Black tank with double lining and bolted logo
The black tank with available double striping is one of the icons of BMW Motorrad history.
Cases
The integrated side cases provide a capacity of over 7 gallons each. Their stylish shape has been integrated into the R 18 B’s streamlined outline: for an unmistakable bagger look. The perfectly coordinated liners made of a sophisticated leather and canvas material mix are available as part of the accessories range.
Cockpit
Four traditional, analog round instruments are included together with a modern 10.25” TFT display: from fuel level indicator to map navigation, you have all the information available at a glance.
Power Reserve
See what you can feel: the traditional, round instrument illustrates the power reserves you haven’t used yet.
TFT display
The 10.25” TFT color display offers you a range of legible information and maximum functionality.
Marshall Gold Series
Available gray cover grilles and golden Marshall lettering: these are the elements that conceal the refined sound quality from a total of four speakers powered by a 180 watt amp.
Boxer engine
We build it with conviction and plenty of passion. Power, endurance, reliability – simply put: a very special boxer experience.
Front Fairing
First impressions count. And this one is impressive. The front fairing installed on the handlebars provides you with ideal protection from the elements and represents a visual highlight with a high recognition value.

The refined gloss-black finishes, modern edge and reinvigorated ride of the Heritage model take nostalgia ripping into a new place. It starts with the performance of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 or 114 engine and the re-invented Softail® frame and suspension. The ride will put a big smile on your face. On top of that, you get a look that drips with gangster-era style. And practical features like a windshield and hard saddlebags for light touring. Tradition is good, but it doesn’t mean sitting still. Available in 107 (1745cc) and 114 (1868cc) engine displacements.

The original tires were just replaced with new Bridgestones, not because of wear but because they were showing signs of age. The bike was built in 2000 by a custom shop in Las Vegas.

The rugged RX4 Adventure has proven itself an unmatched value in the ADV / adventure-touring market, and the addition of an big TFT color instrument panel and new tubeless wire-spoke wheels with electronic tire-pressure sensors makes it even more appealing for 2023!

There is nothing else on the road with the style, versatility, speed and premium features that can touch the RX4’s incredibly affordable $4,995 price. It’s a powerful yet accessible option for riders who desire an economical and manageable ADV bike.

The RX4 includes a huge list of standard features that are typically extra-cost options or unavailable on other motorcycles.

The highlight for 2023 is the beautiful 7-inch TFT color instrument panel that can display tire pressures in real-time and can be linked via Bluetooth to a rider’s smartphone to display incoming calls!

The panel is also customizable to give riders the choice of an analog tachometer layout or a bar-graph tach across the top of the screen, as well as displaying a wealth of other info, including a trip computer with average and real time fuel economy, average and maximum speeds, gear-position indicator, battery voltage, fuel level, coolant temperature and ambient temperature. An ambient light sensor automatically changes the background darker at night so the display isn’t overly distracting.

Other premium features included include full LED lighting, an adjustable windscreen, and a tapered aluminum handlebar. The RX4 also includes adjustable suspension and antilock braking with dual radial-mount four-piston front calipers, as well as the new wire-spoke wheels with a patented design that allows running tires without fussy inner tubes.

The RX4 is powered by a strong 450cc engine that supplies excellent grunt for navigating everything from gnarly trails to speedy highways, and it’s counterbalanced for exceptionally smooth operation. The fuel-injected and liquid-cooled motor produces more than 40 horsepower, enough to easily propel the lightweight RX4 past every speed limit in America.

The efficient single-cylinder engine combines with a 5.3-gallon gas tank to provide a range well beyond 250 miles between refueling stops, allowing your adventures to stretch far from civilization. A robust 300-watt alternator supplies power for any adventurer’s requirements through the included USB and 12-volt charging outlets and two prewired outlets under the seat.

The RX4 is the result of several years of refinement by Zongshen, one of the world’s largest motorcycle producers, and is built to CSC’s specifications to fill a high-demand gap in the dual-sport/adventure market.

""The RX4 delivers the adventure experience with a platform capable of handling anything a rider can throw at it, on road or off, and at an affordable price,” says Steve Seidner, President of CSC Motorcycles. 

The RX4 costs just $4,995, including its wire-spoke wheels with aluminum rims, an inverted fork, and protective engine guards and a skid plate. It also receives a new black treatment for the passenger grab handles and footrests, as well as on the three-piece luggage system that remains standard equipment on the feature-rich RX4.

The RX4’s humble price is due to CSC Motorcycles’ innovative business model of selling direct to consumers. The RX4 undergoes final assembly in our California headquarters and then a road test to ensure flawless operation before shipping directly to customers, with no assembly required.

The RX4 ships to your door for a low flat fee of only $500.00 to most locations in the lower 48 states (some locations may incur additional surcharges) plus assembly and documentation fees, which add just $410 to the price, much less than typical dealer PDI fees. And the RX4 is backed by a one-year unlimited-mileage warranty and a complete set of parts in stock if ever needed.

Nowhere else can you find such a list of features for $4,995, making the RX4 the ultimate value in adventure motorcycles.

“Far and away the most appealing aspect of the RX4 is its price-to-features ratio,” asserted Ari Henning on Revzilla’s Common Tread platform about last year’s RX4 before the 2023 upgrades. “There isn’t a motorcycle on the market that offers so much for so little.”

An aluminum luggage package and many other accessories are available from CSC, including seat options, a burly aluminum skid plate, an ABS-defeat switch, cast aluminum wheels and tire options.

The RX4 is available in vibrant Fire Yellow, Sapphire Blue, Dark Burgundy Metallic, & Arctic White.

The refined gloss-black finishes, modern edge and reinvigorated ride of the Heritage model take nostalgia ripping into a new place. It starts with the performance of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 or 114 engine and the re-invented Softail® frame and suspension. The ride will put a big smile on your face. On top of that, you get a look that drips with gangster-era style. And practical features like a windshield and hard saddlebags for light touring. Tradition is good, but it doesn’t mean sitting still. Available in 107 (1745cc) and 114 (1868cc) engine displacements.

Description
The stripped-down, souped-up, post WWII era look of the bobber is running stronger than ever in the Softail Slim® model. You get the classic look of spoked wheels, chopped mudguards and footboards. And a ride straight out of right now. It’s 16 kilograms lighter, with greater lean angle, than Slim models from just a couple of years ago. And you get the power and soul-satisfying sound of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 V-Twin engine to take you into the future. Fast.

Description
The look of the Fat Boy® is more muscular than ever, thanks to all-new solid-disc wheels, a 240mm rear tire and the 160mm front tire. Add the jaw-dropping satin chrome finishes and signature LED forward lighting, and you’ve got a look that will make an even bigger impact than the first Fat Boy® motorcycle made when it rolled off the line. But now, the Fat Boy® is 29 pounds lighter. You’ll feel the difference that makes the first time you tip it up off its side stand. Combine that with the increased power of the Milwaukee-Eight® V-Twin engine, and then imagine what that means when the light turns green. Hitting the throttle on the Fat Boy® will thrill you. Because underneath, it’s all muscle.Available in 107 and 114 engine displacements.

‘Fully Loaded’ is probably the shortest descriptor we could give this limited edition premium tourer, but somehow we feel you’d appreciate a little more, so here goes.It has our largest 1690cc High Output Twin Cam engine with a smooth, 6-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission, electronic cruise control and electronically linked ABS braking system. It also has a re-crafted batwing fairing (to drastically reduce head buffeting) a 6.5GT touchscreen infotainment system with intuitive hand controls, chrome impeller cast aluminium wheels, premium Tour Pak™, premium saddlebags, and yeah, you guessed it, way more besides.Because as its name suggests, the Electra Glide® Ultra Limited really does have it all.

The icon you love to see and love to be seen on. Powered by a Milwaukee-Eight® 107 engine, the Street Glide® lives up to its name with a fully adjustable rear suspension and a responsive front end that let you hum smoothly along rolling highways and winding roads. Its hot-rod bagger style and iconic batwing fairing may have spawned a slew of imitators, but none can put you into the exhilaratingly focused headspace that the original can—especially with the optional Reflex™ Defensive Rider Systems and BOOM!™ Box GTS infotainment system.

Shoot me a pic of what you have to trade and I'll do the same. I can give you all the specifics and send documentation of the work done on this sweet ride. I'm not picky about brand but Mopar would catch my interest perty quick. Trucks ok. I'm just trying to get something that an old man can use and enjoy for a few more years. classic vehicle of some sort, side by side, boat(I can still fish), building materials, bang bangs. Text is best. I can feel my phone vibrate and I can hear it most of the time if I have it near me but text is definitely best. 208-317-9994 till10.00 p.m. This rig comes with a Kevlar half helmet(Harley Davidson never worn) and a leather jacket(size XL) that has the same logo as the one on the tank.

Guy before me used it as a commuter to and from his naval base in the San Diego area. Recently purchased a Harley, so this one is just going to sit around. Its a fun bike, but very exposed to the elements. Has higher miles, but doesn't miss a beat and all tolerances were perfectly in spec a few thousand miles ago. Will likely need a battery from sitting over the winter, and the chain needs adjusted, but I was riding it as is last summer and wouldn't hesitate to jump on it and ride it across the state. Has a ridiculously loud aftermarket exhaust and is arrow tuned, adjustable brake and clutch levers, only one season on hybrid tires, comes with front and rear stands and a box full of spare parts and manuals etc. One of the factory headlights was broken out, so I mounted a LED bar up front, but I still have the headlights to go with it. Located in kendrick, but I don't have a problem meeting with it somewhat locally. I do travel to Seattle semi frequently as well. I work nights, so texts preferred.",good,675.0,gas,44000.0,black,clean,manual,sport bike,,yes,,,

Only 500 of these were produced worldwide with only 80 or so making it to the U.S.
KTM's are known for being rather tall and hard for many riders to feel comfortable on. This Rally would be perfect for a person that has struggled with tall bikes.
This KTM has the sought after Cone Valve suspension ( $6,500 upgrade ) that has been lowered 1 3/4"" by Solid Performance.
The setup performs extremely well off road with professional tuning and valving.
Set up for a 185lb rider. I rode it on Sunday 10/20/22 in the boise front. I'm 165lbs without gear and the suspension worked flawlessly thru the woops on trail and gravel roads.
Other than my ride on Sunday I do not believe this bike has ever been offroad.
Perfect for a rider that is 5' 6"" - 5' 10""
First service has been performed so you don't have to do anything but ride it for the next 8500 miles.
I suggest checking the air filter after every ride in the dirt.
Extras include a lower Seat Concepts seat bar risers and a Billet case guard. Has quick shift + and Rally Mode installed. Otherwise the bike is stock.
There is a scuff on the left side tank guard from the previous owner. Looks like a parking lot tip over.
No other scuffs or scrapes on the bike.
This bike will not disappoint!

Please don't waste my time with stupid questions and lowball offers. No test rides without endorsement and agreed selling price cash in hand. No off road test rides.

The perfect blend of classic, raw bobber style and contemporary power creates a modern ride with unmistakable old-iron attitude.

Features Include:
Hidden Rear Shocks
If you want a comfortable bike but love that rigid-suspension look, you've come to the right bike. Harley kept all the modern comforts where they belong—below the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage 'hardtail' frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It's a signature rigid look, and you'll only find it on this Softail model.

""Hollywood"" Handlebars and ""Cat Eye"" Console, with color fuel tank monitor and heat cover oil cooler
A cutting-edge ride that's rich with Harley-Davidson history, the Softail Slim model's old-iron soul comes alive right up front. Unique retro-inspired handlebars call back to the glory days of 1940s bobbers, while the gloss-black headlamp cover and the ""Cat Eye"" console with its retro speedo face add even more swing-era swagger.

Narrow Rear Profile
The narrow rear tire and chopped fender with its integrated stop/turn/tail light and side-mounted license plate add up to a stripped-down profile that evokes the iconic, no-nonsense style of classic bobbers. Including long shot exhaust pipes for that deep throat sound.

Round Air Cleaner Cover
The gloss-black retro round air cleaner cover gives the Softail Slim® model's minimalist, blacked-out Twin Cam 103 Engine a raw old-school look—it's modern power with old iron attitude.

Pure Harley-Davidson Styling
Feast your eyes on the Twin Cam 103™ engine and there's no mistaking its roots. This is authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through with an attention to detail you won't find from any other motorcycle company. Medium gray engine with black powder-coated cylinders and cylinder heads are topped off with polished rocker covers and an old school round air cleaner cover for a tough vintage Harley-Davidson attitude. It's a jewel machined out of metal. Pure. Dripping with power. From the classic edge of the cooling fins to the clean lines of cases and covers—the Twin Cam 103™ engine makes an ironclad statement about holding on to what's right and staying true to what satisfies",excellent,103.0,gas,9000.0,black,clean,manual,bobber,,,,,

2023 KTM 50 SX
The 2023 KTM 50 SX is a true READY TO RACE motocross machine. It is a genuine dirt bike that, like its bigger siblings, is produced with top-quality components, real race-bred input, and thoughtful development. It goes without saying that the KTM 50 SX is the only choice when stepping into the world of MX.
Features may include:
Engine
This little ripper of an engine features a high-performance cylinder, exhaust pipe and reed intake system, which are perfectly arranged for maximum performance, setting the standard in the highly competitive 50 cc class.
Wheels
Like the full-size KTM Factory racers, the 2023 KTM 50 SX is fitted with lightweight, black anodized, aluminum rims which provide the highest strength and durability for any eventuality. These are wrapped in new MAXXIS MX-ST tires, to provide unmatched traction on any surface.
Frame
This modern frame is made from lightweight, high strength chromoly steel profiles and combines maximum longitudinal stiffness with optimum torsional rigidity. It guarantees easy handling and precise cornering, but also outstanding stability at speed.
Handlebar
The KTM 50 SX uses a perfectly shaped handlebar made from a high-quality aluminum alloy. It provides a great feeling of control for the rider, helping with overall stability. A pad around the center brace also protects the rider from hard knocks.
Decals
The 2023 KTM 50 SX features the latest in-mold graphics, with a bold orange black and purple design that perfectly sets off the factory-look orange frame, orange seat and race-sharpened bodywork.

Description:

The Honda CR750 is an exceptionally rare motorcycle, the factory-built examples are even rarer still. Four examples of the Honda CR750 were shipped to the United States for the 1970 Daytona 200. The event was one of the most important motorcycle races in the world and Honda took no chances – hiring some of the best motorcycle racers in the world at the time – Dick Mann, Bill Smith, Tommy Robb, and Ralph Bryans. Mann would win the race, by 2 seconds.

Description
The refined gloss-black finishes, modern edge and reinvigorated ride of the Heritage model take nostalgia ripping into a new place. It starts with the performance of the Milwaukee-Eight® 107 or 114 engine and the re-invented Softail® frame and suspension. The ride will put a big smile on your face. On top of that, you get a look that drips with gangster-era style. And practical features like a windshield and hard saddlebags for light touring. Tradition is good, but it doesn’t mean sitting still. Available in 107 (1745cc) and 114 (1868cc) engine displacements.

Runs well. Original Owner, I purchased it to ride back and forth to work on occasion when I worked in the city. 3 mile commute. Mostly rode my bike, this was good for days I took a break.
Only issue's is that horn does not always work, and someone broke into the storage trunk and broke the lock.
Could use a good cleaning. Always stored indoors.
Mostly sits in garage.
Serviced regularly.
13,890 miles.

2023 KTM 300 XC 300 Single-Cylinder 293.2

Price: $11,634.00
Description:

2023 KTM 300 XC
Maximum power at the least possible weight, amplified by low maintenance costs and smooth, linear power delivery - the 2023 KTM 300 XC is set to take the Open category back to school. Churning out massive power from an engine weighing only 52.6 lb, the KTM 300 XC sets the benchmark when it comes to power to weight ratios. Could the 2023 KTM 300 XC be the new Open Class president?
Features may include:
ENGINE & EXHAUST
ENGINE
The new 300 cc 2-stroke powerhouse brings a new choice of weapon to the Open category and provides more choice for racers looking for maximum power at the least possible weight. Along with low maintenance costs and an overall engine weight of just 52.6 lb, the 2023 KTM 300 XC provides pure performance. Coupled together with advanced technical innovations, e-start, electronic fuel injection, and an electronic exhaust control, this is the new cross country kingpin.
CHASSIS
Frame
No matter how gnarly the trail is, you'll stay in complete control thanks to an all-new frame design that has not only been engineered for longitudinal rigidity, but also repositions rotating mass closer to the center of gravity. Thicker frame walls also improve reliability, flex characteristics and offer unmatched rider feel. A new shock mounting also provides improved anti-squat behavior for better traction out of corners, while the footpeg mounting position has moved inwards for less risk of hooking up on roots or rocks. Additionally, the inclusion of forged brackets on the lower frame rails allows for easy installation of the skid plate.
POLYAMIDE-REINFORCED ALUMINIUM SUBFRAME
Weighing in at only 4 lb, the new 2-piece polyamide (60%) reinforced aluminum (40%) subframe provides impressive weight savings. With the help of computational dynamics, carefully calculated rigidity was engineered into the subframe, delivering outstanding handling and feedback, while remaining robust and reliable.
ERGONOMICS & COMFORT
WP XACT FRONT SUSPENSION
48 mm air type WP XACT front fork with a split damping function provides all the confidence you need to attack the trails. New hydrostops in the fork legs improve bottoming-out resistance and account for less rebound when attacking big bumps while hauling across country. Redesigned fork protection rings also increase protection against dirt, making them as reliable as they are awesome.
BODYWORK & GRAPHICS
FUNCTIONAL BODYWORK
The 2023 KTM XC and XC-F range feature an entirely new and improved rider triangle, providing improved knee contact - especially when standing on the pegs - with improved gripping surfaces all around. New plastics work to expel mud buildup in wet, muddy conditions, with a new, flatter seat profile and high-grip orange seat cover providing exceptional rider movement and control. A handy grip pocket under the seat, just above the airbox, makes gripping the bike and lifting it much easier. In terms of graphics, the 2023 KTM XC and XC-F design takes its cue from the early 1990s when purple was one of KTM's predominant colors.
TECHNOLOGY
MAP SELECT SWITCH
The 2023 KTM 300 XC features a map select switch as standard, allowing the racer to switch between 2 perceptible engine maps. Map 1 provides a linear, predictable power delivery, while Map 2 gives it the full beans with crisp, explosive power output.
START/STOP SWITCH
Starting the 2023 KTM 300 XC is as easy as pressing a button. Literally! Lighting quick starts come thanks to an ultra-lightweight 12.8V 2 Ah lithium ion battery placed under the rider's seat, close to the center of gravity, new high-quality stator and pickup and super robust design, and an all-new start/stop button deisgn.

2012 Harley-Davidson® FXDB - Dyna Street Bob V Twin 1584

Price: $11,499.00
Description:

FRESH OIL CHANGE, READY TO ROLL!

2012 Harley-Davidson® Dyna® Street Bob®
The 2012 Harley-Davidson® Dyna® Street Bob® FXDB is a classic bobber motorcycle. If you're looking for bobber motorcycles you'll like the Street Bob®'s slammed solo bobber seat. This seat not only adds to the style of the bike, but also keeps you comfortable. The bobber appearance is also maintained in the post war style stainless steel mini ape hanger handlebar. Add that to the stripped down Dyna® fender, in combination with a good portion of the metal stripped off the bike, and you have a classic bobber motorcycle look. The 1940s sausage taillight also adds to the classic bobber motorcycle style. The classic look continues with the Harley® Street Bob® FXDB's black laced steel 19 inch Harley® wheels. And the blacked out rims, match the blacked out style of the Twin Cam 96 engine.
Features may include:
MINI ""APE-HANGER"" HANDLEBAR
Grab hold of the stainless steel mini ape-hanger handlebar and put your fists way up in the wind—it'll take you back to the good old days of post-war bobbers. And for that clean and minimalist, bobber look, the wires are routed inside the steel.
BOBBER SOLO SEAT
True to the old school bobber look, a slammed solo seat drops you in nice and snug to the bike and close to the pavement beneath you. It's the ultimate bond with the road and your machine. Get the quintessential bobber style without sacrificing the comfort of the ride.
CHOPPED REAR FENDER
Lose the support covers and a good chunk of metal and you get another important feature of the bobber from yesteryear: the chopped rear fender. Stripped down clean, this fender offers just enough surface for low-profile taillights and a license plate bracket. Give other riders more tire to look at when you blow past them.
BLACKED OUT RIMS
Raw, gritty and no-nonsense—the Street Bob® motorcycle features black laced steel wheels and stainless steel spokes with an aggressive 19"" wheel up front to lead your way out of the mundane. Blacked out like the Harley-Davidson® Twin Cam engine, these wheels make a bold statement and provide a smooth, true ride.
STOP-TURN-TAIL LIGHTS
Old school looks meet new-school engineering. Chrome, retro-style bullet taillights combine functionality to work twice as hard—stop beams and running lights plus turn indicators in two low-profile rear lamps.
